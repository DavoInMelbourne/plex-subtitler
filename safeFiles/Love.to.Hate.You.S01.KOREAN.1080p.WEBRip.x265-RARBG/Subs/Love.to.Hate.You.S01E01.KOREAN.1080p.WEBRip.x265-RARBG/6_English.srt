00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:58,516
Excuse me. You gotta wake up. Okay?

2
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:01,019
Come on, wake up.

3
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:04,856
You should go home. Right?

4
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:07,817
You… you… you… thief!

5
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,111
Help!

6
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:12,113
Look. You wanna be in one piece.

7
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:14,741
Right? Shh.

8
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:22,874
What is this?

9
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:24,876
Who are you, you crazy bitch?

10
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:28,254
Hey, just go. Just get lost, all right?

11
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:30,131
Go on!

12
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:34,844
Goddamn it!

13
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:45,688
I'm… I'm sorry.

14
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,530
Please stop!

15
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,837
<i>Passengers</i>
<i>traveling southbound,</i>

16
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,506
<i>please make your transfer</i>

00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:14,425
<i>The doors are on your right.</i>

18
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:16,469
A BRAVE CIVILIAN? OR AN ASSAILANT?

19
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:17,512
Huh?

20
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,769
Uh, excuse me.

21
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:27,564
<i>The culprit suffers from injuries…</i>

22
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,691
Oh my God.
<i>-…that require six weeks of hospital care.</i>

23
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:31,442
<i>What do you mean,</i>
<i>violent criminal?</i>

24
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:33,236
<i>That person saved my life.</i>

25
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,612
<i>And was it a woman?</i>

26
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,489
<i>It was a man, right?</i>

27
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:39,868
<i>Hey, how was the flight?</i>

28
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:43,454
You have a death wish, huh?
Just call the cops and let them handle it.

29
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:46,291
Do you purposely go around town
seeking out men to beat up?

30
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:48,877
How did you find that out? Even my mom
couldn't tell it was me.

31
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,713
<i>You're just a female thug</i>
<i>and a lawyer on the side!</i>

32
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:53,965
Hey! What do you mean by "female"?
A thug is a thug.

33
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:55,258
It's not just men, all right?

34
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:57,635
<i>Thanks for your concern though.</i>
<i>I'll call you later.</i>

35
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,137
Hey, hey!

36
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:06,060
How could you…
answer a call in the middle of this?

37
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:08,146
Aw, come on, you didn't like that?

38
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:10,231
Usually, I take calls
in the middle of doing it.

39
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:15,695
Oh!

40
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,030
What's wrong?

41
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:19,991
It kinda feels like I'm just some
sort of cheap one-night stand for you.

42
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:21,868
You know, we could end up dating,

43
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:24,579
and this could be
our first night of many to come.

44
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:25,622
I mean, that's possible.

45
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,373
Wow.

46
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:30,001
We talked for two hours,
and I had no idea.

47
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:32,587
You're quite the romantic and open-minded.

48
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,631
Most men usually hit it and quit it,

49
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:38,134
but they'd never consider women
who do too to be their girlfriend.

50
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:51,689
<i>Womanizer type one.</i>

51
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:52,774
I'm gonna go rinse off.

52
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:54,776
<i>Men who really wanted to have</i>
<i>a one-night stand.</i>

53
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:56,361
Okay.

54
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:59,239
<i>For these guys,</i>
<i>they don't care who they do it with.</i>

55
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:01,407
-Uh…
-I'd like to drink alone.

56
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,868
Come on, you should have stayed home
if that's the case.

57
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:06,246
-Why would you come here?
-Just leave me be.

58
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,414
Oh, come on. I'm being friendly.

59
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:12,001
Type two. Sex is the only thing
these types of men think about.

60
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,545
-What?
-Don't get me wrong, I enjoy sex too.

61
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:17,090
But men who're easy, not my cup of tea.

62
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:19,467
<i>Womanizer type three.</i>

63
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:23,888
Hi there. Let's just go with the flow.
There's no need to know names or ages.

64
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:29,519
-You're married, right?
-How'd you know?

65
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,229
-<i>Men who are married…</i>
-Divorced.

66
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:33,189
<i>…or have girlfriends.</i>

67
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,774
<i>A new addition.</i>

68
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:37,193
<i>A romantic who likes</i>
<i>the movie</i> Before Sunrise.

69
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:40,446
<i>I'm surprised he exists.</i>

70
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,491
Shall we get
a couple more drinks and come back?

71
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:45,952
-I thought you lost the mood.
-Yeah, I did earlier.

72
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:47,495
But leaving now doesn't feel right.

73
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:50,707
You like it, then you don't like it.
I'm not really liking your fickleness.

74
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,168
-But you're okay.
-All right.

75
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,296
You're pretty chill. I like that.

76
00:04:58,339 --> 00:04:59,549
Honey.

77
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:10,476
I don't have to say sorry to you, do I?
We only just met today.

78
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,646
You met him today?
You just met him, and you…

79
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,692
Hon, what's going on? Who is this?

80
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:22,322
You must have dated her for a while.
I've known Jin-suh for about eight years.

81
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:23,781
We've been dating,

82
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,283
what, six months?

83
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:26,242
Seriously?

84
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,245
Whoa, so you're not just chill.
You're coldhearted.

85
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,039
Take care. Bye. Have a good one.

86
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:33,833
-You son of a bitch!
-Oh, that's--

87
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:36,044
Don't you ever let me see you again!

88
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:38,004
Baby. I mean, Ji-yeong.

89
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:44,302
Too bad we ran into each other
like this, eh? And, man, she seems angry.

90
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,138
"We've been dating for six months"?

91
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:49,974
Were we really dating,
or were you just sleeping around?

92
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:52,310
I honestly don't think
you're in a position to complain.

93
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:54,645
-We're both doing the same thing.
-Same thing?

94
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,647
We end here nice and clean. See ya.

95
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,903
We're not the same. You were
on your way out, and I just got here.

96
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:04,864
You've already done it. I didn't do it!

97
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:12,038
<i>Door closing.</i>

98
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:20,588
Did you drive here?

99
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:24,675
It's dangerous for you to drive
while you're mad.

100
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,719
I just want you to drive safely.

101
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,971
Did you already know
that he was two-timing you?

102
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:32,225
Kinda. Did he ever flip his phone
to hide his screen from you?

103
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:36,562
Uh… Why didn't you break up with him then?

104
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,981
I don't have to give up
my season pass to Universal

105
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,651
just 'cause I had fun at Disneyland.
It's kind of like that.

106
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,778
And men do this kind of stuff too.

107
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:46,030
Especially those who are powerful.

108
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,783
<i>The Best Actor Award</i>
<i>goes to Nam Kang-ho.</i>

109
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:52,078
Mr. Nam Kang-ho
already has many nicknames,

110
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:54,455
"Master of Kiss," "God of Romance,"

111
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,666
and now he can add
"Best Actor in the Country."

112
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:59,585
Oh, and it's not just in Korea.

113
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:02,296
He also recently appeared
in a Hollywood film.

114
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,174
This evening, many
of his international fans are here.

115
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:11,764
Now, please go ahead
with your acceptance speech.

116
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:15,101
Yes. Well, thank you all very much.

117
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:18,938
All these years, I'd say
that it's an honor just to be nominated.

118
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:22,066
But frankly, I wanted
to win this at least once.

119
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:30,158
I love acting.
It's always been a big part of me.

120
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:33,369
I couldn't have done it
without, uh, all your support.

121
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,538
I can't single out

122
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:37,915
each and every one of you.

123
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,669
But I'll try and reach out
to thank them all individually.

124
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:44,797
And there's somebody
I consider a soulmate,

125
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:48,259
Do Won-jun, my benefactor
and a good friend to me.

126
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:50,094
For as long as you will allow me,

127
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:53,181
I'll be an actor until the day that I die.
Thank you so much!

128
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:13,284
Congrats! You did it!

129
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:25,463
Hey, you did well.

130
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:30,510
<i>Congrats to you both for winning</i>

-Yeah.

132
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:33,763
<i>What would be a role</i>

133
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:34,847

134
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:37,558
<i>Maybe a steamy romance</i>
<i>with a handsome young man?</i>

135
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:42,063
<i>There are already plenty of men</i>
<i>who do that with younger women.</i>

136
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:43,189
<i>Am I right?</i>

137
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:45,525
<i>Yes. Yes, Ms. Choi Soo-jin.</i>

138
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:48,110
Why would she say
something like that on live TV, man?

139
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,612
Oh gosh.

140
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,364
<i>Right.</i>

141
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,868
So it's a crime
when an old man dates a young woman,

142
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:58,579
and it's a romance
when an old woman dates a young guy?

143
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,998
Hey, did you write this comment here?

144
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:03,584
No.

145
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:05,920
-It's verbatim, word for word.
-No way.

146
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:07,088
Look at it.

147
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:09,006
-It sounds like you.
-It wasn't me.

148
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:12,134
-Well, it sounds exactly like you.
-Let me see.

149
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,053
-Is it my username?
-Here.

150
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:17,056
Come on. You can always set up
a new account, can't you?

151
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:19,100
-Okay. So what if it was?
-I knew it.

152
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:20,893
It's not, seriously.

153
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,770

00:09:58,055 --> 00:09:58,889
Here.

170
00:09:58,973 --> 00:09:59,807
Let's go.

171
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:04,395
BAD GIRL

172
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:07,857
"To the parents
who have raised the attorney Yeo Mi-ran

173
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:12,069
with great care and love,
you must have spent countless days

174
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:14,989
praying as you raised
your daughter to become a lawyer."

175
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:18,367
"The pity you must have felt
as she studied throughout the night."

176
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:21,162
"How worried you must have been,
lest she get sick during exams."

177
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:24,498
"There must be
no way you could ever forget

178
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,209
the day when she passed the bar exam."

179
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,587
We'll report this
as a personal info theft.

180
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:32,506
How did a marriage broker
find out our address?

181
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,803
"However, the concern
for your child will never end."

182
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:41,557
"That is because a single marriage
can either make or break a whole life."

183
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:45,478
"I have 25 years' experience
in the field, and with the heart

184
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:49,732
of a loving mother, I'm truly dedicated
to helping you find the best suitor for--"

185
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,025
We having breakfast or what?

186
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:53,235
Why must you read
something like that to the end?

187
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,071
This one is a bit different.

188
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,657
Look, it's handwritten,
not just some printout.

189
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,784
So what? That's supposed
to make her jump with glee?

190
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:04,872
-Why are you yelling at Mom again?
-Oh, no, he wasn't yelling.

191
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:07,917
It's just that you've not shown
any interest in any of these arrangements.

192
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,251
Dad was concerned. That's all.

193
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,921
But why does he have to yell at you?
I'm just not interested.

194
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,089
Whoa, whoa, what's this?

195
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,508
How dare you raise your voice at your dad?
So disrespectful.

196
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:18,719
Come on. Why are you both
at each other over nothing?

197
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,971
I'll make you something.
Eat before work, 'kay?

198
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,390
I have something to tell you.

199
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:27,228
What's this?

200
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:30,231
It's the tuition to the law school
you said you didn't want me to go to.

201
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:31,941
I said I'd pay you back.

202
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:34,694
Um…

203
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,366
ONE HUNDRED MILLION WON

204
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:46,288
A third of it was from my part-time job,
but I put some more in there for you

205
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,499
for feeding me
and letting me stay at home.

206
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,753
The reason I was against you
taking the bar exam

207
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:55,798
was because I was worried
you would waste the money and time

208
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:59,969
after all that effort. Even graduates
from top law schools fail the bar exam.

209
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,721
So I'll be moving.

210
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,973
You're gonna be director then?

211
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:07,226
There's only two of you at the firm.
One's CEO, and the other's director?

212
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:10,688
No, I mean I'm moving out of here.
I'll be living on my own from now on.

213
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,984
-What is she saying right now?
-Huh?

214
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:17,403
She said she'll move out.

215
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:21,407
You disapprove whatever I do anyway.
There's no point telling you.

216
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,951
Mom didn't know either,
so don't you yell at her.

217
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:25,202
See you later.

218
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:26,829
Hey, stay for breakfast.

219
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,998
I'm gonna be late.
I'll see you later, okay?

220
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,879
It won't be long
before she's saying goodbye forever.

221
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:37,673
Why didn't you tell me?
You must have known about this!

222
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:42,219
I told you not to yell at her!
If you must, just yell at me!

223
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:45,222
Why must you yell at Mom, huh?
Because she's easy to pick on?

224
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,266
-You rude little--
-Oh, what's the matter with you?

225
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:48,350
Go to work, okay?

226
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:52,813
Be careful, sweetie. Get something to eat
when you get to work, all right?

227
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:56,567
This country is a total mess
because of lawyers like you! Huh?

228
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:59,487
He took out a loan
worth 40 million in your name.

229
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,031
He spent 20 to buy a car
and saved the rest.

230
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:04,492
But then, he sold that car
and made another ten.

231
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:07,453
He made 30 per car loan.
There are 29 cases altogether.

232
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:10,498
That means there are
29 folks just like you.

233
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:13,459
But wait, how did he get a 40-mil loan
to buy a car that costs 20?

234
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:15,044
And with a young guy's name?

235
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:18,339
There's an insider at the finance firm
who adjusts the credit limit.

236
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:20,007
That person and the pimp are in cahoots.

237
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,801
That son of a bitch.

238
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:24,261
I really don't know
anything about this.

239
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,555
He told me that he'd pay me
four million a month

240
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,681
if I let him use my name.

241
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:32,019
After the first payment,
he hasn't received anything for a year.

242
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:33,771
He really doesn't know
anything, Detective.

243
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:38,025
Honestly, I didn't know
that guy would do this to me.

244
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:41,445
And I was so nice to him.

245
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,697
This is so unfair.

246
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:48,202
Hey. Don't worry.
I won't let you take the fall for this.

247
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:51,163
-I wanna kill him.
-Of course you do.

248
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,957
They were wrong for that.

249
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:55,668
I'm gonna catch him and kill him.

250
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:57,503
You can't actually kill him.

251
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:05,845
Detective Lee will catch him for sure.
His nickname is "God's Right Hand."

252
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,724
You met him at a boxing gym.

253
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,560
How could you have let this happen to you?

254
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:15,020
We met at a boxing gym too.
Should I not be trusting you?

255
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,355
Hey, you, listen.

256
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:24,238
Eat some food. All right?

257
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:28,951
Thank you.

258
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,328
I got you.
The food's getting cold, so eat it!

259
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:37,334
You know, you're a really good person.

260
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:39,211
-Hurry up and eat.
-Okay.

261
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,187
Let's go.

262
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:01,817
Ugh, this place is so damn far away. Man!

263
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,320
We good?

264
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:07,531
Dude, is it cute
for a grown woman to act like that?

265
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:10,451
She just lost everything.
She'd be so miserable

266
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:13,495
she'd want to kill herself. Now she acts
like this 'cause of the nice view?

267
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:16,248
-Romance writers are all psychos, huh?
-Oh, yeah?

268
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:19,043
And she's clumsy too.
Why would anyone like her?

269
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:20,628
Her character's the worst,

270
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:22,463
but then everybody starts to think

271
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:24,632
that when she speaks up,
she has conviction.

272
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:28,093
Well, if you're sick of it,
then just stop watching.

273
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:30,679
Let's go.

274
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:33,349
-Huh?
-The rehearsal.

275
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,773
I'm the one who's miserable, 'kay?

276
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:41,690
Come on, man.

277
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:46,987
An action or a film noir role
would be a nice change. I'm sick of this.

278
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:49,323
Oh, go ahead and do it
if you get an offer.

279
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:50,824
-Hello.
-Oh, hello. Yes.

280
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,493
Wow, he's so handsome.

281
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:56,246
Hey, but if you take on those projects,
you'll wind up injured and traumatized.

282
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,748
And you won't get commercials.

283
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:59,667
-Hello.
-Hello.

284
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,251
-Yes.
-Have you eaten?

285
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,711
-Yeah.
-He's so charming!

286
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,254
Commercials? Ugh!

287
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,340
You're such an opportunist.

288
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:10,511
Okay. Let's just stay off
romance for a while then.

289
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:12,429
It'd be nice to rest a bit.

290
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:13,722
-Hello.
-Hello.

291
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:16,850
-Oh!Oh, hey, hello.
-Hello.

292
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:18,936
We meet again on this project.

293
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:21,271
-Let's do this!
-Yeah.

294
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:26,360
That guy should have been
an actor himself.

295
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:28,862
He did try once,
but he was really bad at acting.

296
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:31,657
Ah. So God didn't give him everything.

297
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,159
Okay,
you're the "Master of Kiss,"

298
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:35,869
so why don't we show them how it's done?

299
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:38,956
But it can't just be a kiss.
it has to be sensual.

300
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,347
Don't close your eyes.

301
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,933
What? Was there a line here?

302
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,059
An ad-lib.

303
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:02,896
Oh! That was good.
Hey, I think my heart just skipped a beat.

304
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,232
Wow, you've really gotten better.

305
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:06,150
Not bad, man.

306
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:08,902
And that thing you just said,
"Don't close your eyes," or something,

307
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:10,779
ask the director to add
that in no matter what.

308
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:11,780
Hmm.

309
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:15,701
And also, don't turn
and bring your face in close like this.

310
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:18,037
Instead, wrap your arm
around the waist and pull her in.

311
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:21,457
So if you wrap your arm
around her waist and pull her in,

312
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,668
the girl will be in this position,
so when she tries to pull her head away,

313
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:28,130
she'll naturally just…
fall back on the couch.

314
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:29,339
-You see?
-Oh.

315
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:30,340
Okay.

316
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:33,761
-Yeah. All right, get in the mood. Here.
-Yeah.

317
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,721
Ready and action.

318
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:58,660
Don't close your eyes.

319
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:18,806
Whoa! Ah, shit!

320
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:21,100
-Damn.
-That was my bad.

321
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:24,186
-That was on purpose.
-Huh? Bro, I just fell over.

322
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,938
-Oh jeez.
-Hey, wait.

323
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:27,314
That was our first kiss.

324
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:29,525
What are you saying, nutjob?

325
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:30,984
-Get off me.
-Oh, wait.

326
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,986
-Damn it, get off!
-Hold on. Okay.

327
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,740
I'm… I'm sorry.

328
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:39,409
Hey! Why are you sorry?
Where are you going? Where are you going?

329
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:42,412
Hey, we're rehearsing here.
Rehearsing the scene!

330
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,500
-Jeez.
-Why are you shocked?

331
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,043
What's up with the sigh of relief?

332
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,421
I'm not doing this.
You practice with him from now on.

333
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:53,132
Come on, why are you so grossed out?

334
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,218
Well, um…

335
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:59,263
Oh, yeah, why are you here?

336
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,682
They say the shoot
will be delayed for a bit,

337
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:05,144
so you should relax and wait here.
Or take a nap or something, yeah?

338
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,813
What?
That means we won't finish today.

339
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:09,356
It's Hwang Ji-hye, am I right?

340
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,445
What's all this?

341
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,781
Bonus for winning the case.

342
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:20,701
-Huh?
-I'd say this is better, yeah?

343
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:24,204
We probably couldn't sell
that empty lot we got last time.

344
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:27,374
How can this be better?
What will you do with these?

345
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:29,793
I'll… eat them. You'll eat them.

346
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:33,297
We'll give them away
and donate them.

347
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,133
There wouldn't be a way
to sell all these, right?

348
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:38,677
Ah! Seung-gu has a truck.
Maybe we can borrow it?

349
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,138
Oh, really? Good idea.

350
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:45,934
Hey, Seung-gu.
We were actually just talking about you.

351
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,770
<i>Mi-ran, those assholes</i>
<i>are partying in Jindo.</i>

352
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:51,231
<i>-I'm going there to catch them.</i>
-What are you doing?

353
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:53,734
You there? Huh?

354
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:55,527
What's wrong? He asked for money?

355
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:57,446
Seung-gu says he's on his way
to catch the pimp.

356
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:59,281
-Where?
-Jindo.

357
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:00,199
Where in Jindo?

358
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:04,328
I wanna kill him.
I'm gonna catch him and kill him.

359
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:08,457
Sung-ho,
call the police right away.

360
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,708
-Do it!
-Oh, sure.

361
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,545
<i>I just got a call</i>
<i>from Detective Lee.</i>

362
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:15,130
<i>They're in Sol Beach Resort.</i>

363
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,216
<i>The room is booked under</i>
<i>the pimp's younger brother.</i>

364
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:18,884
Did he call the authorities in Jindo?

365
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:20,302
<i>Yeah, he said he did.</i>

366
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,221
Okay, thank you.

367
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,098
Oh, Seung-gu.

368
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:27,267
Seung-gu, please don't cause any trouble.

369
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:31,897
-Please don't cause any trouble.
-I'll be fine.

370
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,149
Mr. Do!

371
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:36,568
-I… I'm…
-What's up?

372
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:39,696
-I'm sorry, but I need your help.
-Huh?

373
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,908
She may not listen to the director,
but she may listen to another actor.

374
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:44,785
What is the issue?

375
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,497
I mean…
You're saying that the reason

376
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:52,084
you won't put on makeup is you might get
an ad offer from other brands?

377
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:55,712
As soon as the show comes out,
I'm sure that I'll get an offer.

378
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:59,132
See, if I were to use
another brand's makeup during the show,

379
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:00,801
what would the advertiser say?

380
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:04,429
How about this?
I could just get my hair touched up.

381
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:07,432
-Do I have to use makeup?
-Okay, okay.

382
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:10,519
See, there haven't been
any beauty offers just yet.

383
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,646
And I have a scene to shoot.

384
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:15,399
We've also managed to obtain sponsorship,

385
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:17,818
so you'll have to work with us on this.

386
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:21,238
Why must I be responsible
for your sponsorship?

387
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,574
It's not my responsibility either.

388
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:28,996
Do you have any idea how hard things are?
Production is losing money!

389
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,789
Huh? Losing money! In the red!

390
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:32,958
Can I just confirm?

391
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:35,794
Did you just raise your voice just then?

392
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,672
I can't just stand here.

393
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:41,883
I'm the lead. When there's a delay,
I have a responsibility to the production.

394
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,428
The crew are on standby.
We gotta shoot the scene.

395
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:46,054
I agree, we do.

396
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,682
But she won't open up to you.

397
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:51,059
If you go there
and take one look at her face,

398
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,519
you think you can hold your tongue?

399
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:55,564
The moment you see her face,
you'll lose your temper.

400
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:58,108
Watching her at the beach scene,
you couldn't stand her.

401
00:21:58,191 --> 00:22:00,277
And there you were,
going on about how awful she was.

402
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,863
I took my meds. I can hold it in.

403
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:05,574
How many times has
that medicine failed you, huh?

404
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:09,578
You drove at least ten actresses to tears
even after taking that medicine.

405
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:12,914
Then I was the only one
who cleaned up the whole mess.

406
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:15,167
I learned the hard way.

407
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,461
I won't let you get involved
in any situations like this.

408
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:18,378
Listen.

409
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,757
I won't mess up this time.

410
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,050
For once, just trust me.

411
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:25,302
No, no. I won't fall for it.

412
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:27,012
-No way.
-Just once, man.

413
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:30,057
-No casualties.
-What do you mean?

414
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,641
-Where are you going?
-Thanks.

415
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:33,602
-Thanks for what?
-You're the best.

416
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:35,187
Hey, you don't wanna do that.

417
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,314
-Yeah, thanks.
-Hey!

418
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:41,526
You.

419
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,320
Damn it! Shit.

420
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,699
Who the hell are you? Asshole.

421
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:49,076
Damn you!

422
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:55,582
-Take him inside.
-Get him!

423
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:57,334
-You're dead!
-Hey!

424
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:59,795
Son of a bitch! Damn it, you asshole.

425
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:01,713
Get inside!

426
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,006
What? Seung-gu!

427
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:04,633
Help!

428
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:23,402
Hey!

429
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,831
What are you doing?

430
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:47,759
-Hey, are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm good.

431
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:52,097
Ow!

432
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,474
-Isn't she a lawyer?
-More like Michelle Yeoh.

433
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:58,812
Oh!Hmm.

434
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:12,200
Kang-ho. I'm sorry about all this.

435
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,286
It's all right. I'm here to talk to her.

436
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:21,376
Ji-hye, I'm sure there's
a reason why you're acting this way.

437
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,837
There's something I wanna share
from my years in the industry.

438
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,422
Would you like to hear me out?

439
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:30,135
As you can see,
we are really lucky to work here.

440
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:34,181
The director's nice, and there're
no last-minute script changes.

441
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:36,183
This script was finalized a week ago.

442
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:39,186
So, let's just go with this one.

443
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:41,229
The crew are all waiting on us.

444
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:42,147
Okay?

445
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:45,984
This is how it is.

446
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:47,903
We just make do and shoot.

447
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:49,738
What do you think?

448
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:51,656
Huh?

449
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:57,913
But, Kang-ho, this is different.

450
00:24:58,413 --> 00:24:59,581
This is a scene

451
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:01,458
where the director said

452
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:04,294
I'm supposed to be getting pretty
so I can go on a date with a guy.

453
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:06,755
So I came up with an idea.

454
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:08,715
Instead of putting on makeup,

455
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:11,384
I was thinking maybe
something like this would help.

456
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:14,804
Like this.

457
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:17,891
Or this.

458
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:20,018
And…

459
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:22,437
Or a cute smile like this?

460
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:26,900
<i>Cheap flirting</i>
<i>shows that you have no class.</i>

461
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:31,071
Or maybe… sexy could work.

462
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:34,574
Maybe like…

463
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:37,536
Just like that.

464
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:43,542
I'll pretend to tie back my hair
and show him the nape of my neck.

465
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:47,170
<i>Again, it's cheap, not sexy.</i>
<i>Please stop.</i>

466
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:58,682
Ji-hye! Huh?

467
00:25:58,765 --> 00:26:00,433
What are you doing? Hurry.

468
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:02,394
-Ji-hye! Just talk to me.
-Hey, stop!

469
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:04,062
Ji-hye, stop running!

470
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:05,814
-My legs are hurting!
-Oh no, she's leaving!

471
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:06,982
-Ji-hye!
-Hurry!

472
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:09,276
Ji-hye! Oh, seriously? Ji-hye!

473
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:11,403
You're really annoying me right now.

474
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:13,154
Ji-hye, please open up, 'kay?

475
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:16,074
Open the door.
Oh my gosh, stop! Oh, come on.

476
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:18,660
What do we do now?
She can't just leave like this!

477
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,745
What do we do?

478
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,872
-Ah, what do we do?
-Why does this happen to me?

479
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:24,624
She's really-- Oh jeez!

480
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,835
-But still there's a chance.
-I don't know. Call her!

481
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:28,003
Oh! Oh, wait!

482
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:33,633
Bro, I didn't say anything. I swear.

483
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:36,845
I just said that the crew was waiting
and we should just go with the script.

484
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:42,851
And somehow she stormed out
looking that angry?

485
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:46,438
Well, of course she was acting ridiculous,
so she might have seen it on my face.

486
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:48,690
But I wasn't being mean to her
or anything, dude!

487
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:52,402
The security camera.
Don't they have them inside?

488
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:54,237
You can check to see if I said anything.

489
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:56,698
If I had known this would happen,

490
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:58,992
I would have just said
what I was thinking.

491
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:00,452
Hey, are you an actress?

492
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:02,704
Are you in this just for commercials?

493
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:06,249
You won't get any commercial contracts.
You know why?

494
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:07,876
'Cause you really suck!

495
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:12,088
At the boxing gym,
you were taking it easy.

496
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:14,257
-You studied physical education?
-No, silly.

497
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:16,426
I did humanities. I went to a law school.

498
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:18,637
Ah, that's right. You're a lawyer.

499
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:21,973
-Where's your car?
-Uh, over there.

500
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:24,351
Oh, yeah? Mine's here.

501
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:27,562
I guess we'll part here.
Just get home safely, okay?

502
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:30,857
You really helped me out. Thank you.

503
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:33,985
Okay. Just remember to work hard
and be good to your mom.

504
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,238
-See ya.
-Okay. See ya later.

505
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:38,573
Bye.

506
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:47,123
She's just trying to find herself
a mega-rich guy,

507
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:48,541
so why does she even work?

508
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,752
So she can bring up her status.

509
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:55,006
Because she thinks
that if she raises her value,

510
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,800
everyone will bid on her, right?

511
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:02,138
After all, that's
every woman's dream, I suppose.

512
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:05,684
-Are you finished?
-Yeah.

513
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:07,727
-Then get in the car.
-You aren't coming?

514
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,564
The director is
a mess right now. How can I leave?

515
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:14,359
-I didn't do it. Hwang Ji-hye did it.
-Just get in.

516
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:26,996
<i>Because she thinks</i>
<i>that if she raises her value,</i>

517
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,331
<i>everyone will bid on her, right?</i>

518
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:29,624
NAM KANG-HO, THE GOOD ANGEL

519
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:30,959
NAM KANG-HO, MAN OF MANNERS

520
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:31,960
<i>After all…</i>

521
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:33,128
ATTENTIVE, HAND MANNERS

522
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:35,171
…<i>that's every woman's dream, I suppose.</i>

523
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:36,339
LEG MANNERS THIS TIME

524
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:38,591
<i>It's a new type.</i>

525
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,468
<i>The vampire.</i>

526
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:42,721
Here's your beer.

527
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:48,727
It's kind of a psychopath type, you know?

528
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:51,604
They win the hearts of women,
then they live off that energy

529
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:53,940
yet think women are worthless
and only see them as prey.

530
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:57,944
No way. And it was him for sure?

531
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:01,156
Yes, I checked to make sure.
Nam Kang-ho and Hwang Ji-hye

532
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:02,198
had a shoot right there.

533
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:03,950
Then was he just rehearsing?

534
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:06,494
Hey, who gets all angry
while rehearsing a script?

535
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:10,081
Also, even if it was out of context,
there's no way he didn't mean it.

536
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:13,877
He's basically a misogynist
who treats women like something to be won!

537
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:17,130
I was such a big fan of him.

538
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:20,300
No, it can't be true.
You must be mistaken.

539
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:24,554
How much do you know about men?
You always go for the handsome ones.

540
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:27,515
Do you have any idea how men talk
about women when they're alone at night?

541
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,350
Love? I don't think so.

542
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:32,020
Women are just for sex,
and they're objects for ownership.

543
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:34,105
When their girlfriends dump them,
they watch porn!

544
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:36,107
Porn! They use it to comfort each other.
No joke!

545
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:39,819
And they also feel superior
as if they can toy with women's hearts.

546
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:41,654
They're just a bunch
of assholes by nature.

547
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:44,282
They cower before those who are strong
and trample on the weak.

548
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:46,993
And all they want to do is
to categorize women as the weaker sex.

549
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:50,997
-It's hot in here.
-Not all men are like that, you know.

550
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:53,708
Oh, there's one. An exception.

551
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,127
I know, why'd you dump him?
He's a rare breed.

552
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:57,796
And he's actually kinda cute too.

553
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:59,881
Did I date him?
What do you mean, I dumped him?

554
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:02,467
Oh gosh. Hey, Na-eun, it's been a while.

555
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:03,718
How have you been?

556
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:06,763
-Excuse me. I'd like one too.
-Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

557
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:09,599
Wow, the subordinate gets off work early
and is drinking,

558
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:12,894
and the boss stays and finishes work.
What a dream job you have.

559
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:14,687
Oh, come on.

560
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:18,441
Mi-ran has to work so much
because money's so tight.

561
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:21,945
Hey, do you know
who wants to buy potatoes or useless land?

562
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:23,988
What do you mean?

563
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:25,031
Don't say it.

564
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:27,700
We got paid
with potatoes and an empty lot.

565
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:29,702
Huh? They didn't pay you the fees?

566
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:32,372
It's not like that.

567
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:34,582
Sung-ho made the deal
right from the beginning.

568
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,417
-Oh, here!
-Here's your beer.

569
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,837
Mi-ran and Na-eun,
congrats on your freedom, huh?

570
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:40,547
I wish you good luck!

571
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,757
Yeah, thank you very… munch.

572
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:47,971
Where are you?

573
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:50,849
You still with the director?

574
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:53,476
Yeah. Don't worry about me, okay?

575
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,894
Sorry, bro.

576
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:56,729
Good night.

577
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:58,022
-<i>Okay</i>.
-Yeah.

578
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:06,739
Look, Kang-ho is
really, really worried about you.

579
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:07,907
He's worried sick.

580
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:10,326
You know what he said earlier?

581
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:12,203
Kang-ho wants to cheer you up.

582
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:14,581
Aw, Kang-ho is so great!

583
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:16,916
Oh, thank you so much.

584
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:19,586
I know you must be very busy, Mr. Do.

585
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:20,920
Oh, you see, I'm just…

586
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:23,798
I'm just doing my job, you know.

587
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:27,135
It's been so long since we've been able
to share drinks together.

588
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:29,804
And it just makes me really happy.

589
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,848
-I mean it!
-Oh yeah, by the way…

590
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:36,686
It was Hwang Ji-hye who caused
all that trouble. She hasn't called once.

591
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:40,398
Because of her, I'm so upset.

592
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:43,151
Oh, wow. This must be so hard for you.

593
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:47,030
I'm sure Ji-hye
is also feeling very sorry right now.

594
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:50,408
Don't worry about it.
You know, I will talk with her soon,

595
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:54,495
and… I'll make sure the show goes on!

596
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,414
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

597
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:58,666
I'm really counting on you, Mr. Do.

598
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,543
Leave it to me.

599
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:03,046
Whoa, whoa, hey. Wait, wait, wait!

600
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:05,673
What do you think you're doing?
You're already so drunk.

601
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:08,509
Why? Let's go somewhere
and have another drink!

602
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:12,138
-Goodbye! Have a good night.
-Okay, get home safely.

603
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:13,598
Okay, have a good night.

604
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:19,228
Oh, thanks a lot!

605
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:22,023
-Hey, are you okay?
-Oh, yeah. I'm good.

606
00:32:22,982 --> 00:32:25,151
Just hang in there.
Your cab is almost here.

607
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:27,737
Mr. Do, you know, I'm…

608
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:30,531
I'm really stressed.

609
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:34,953
I get pushed and tossed around,
and I'm so stressed.

610
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:37,538
Okay.

611
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:40,583
I know, I know. You're in the middle,
getting pushed around,

612
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:43,336
and you do have the toughest job.
I know that, really.

613
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:46,673
That's why
we should have another drink.

614
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:47,924
Just one more.

615
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:50,093
-One more drink!
-Oh, wow. Look.

616
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:54,430
-Oh, look at the time. It's late.
-Oh, come on, please!

617
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:57,183
One more drink.
There's a place right here. If I buy--

618
00:32:57,266 --> 00:32:59,644
Huh? Whoa, whoa, whoa. W… wait. Hey.

619
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,021
I'm fine.

620
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:03,690
-You good?
-Yep.

621
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:04,649
You swallowed it?

622
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:07,068
-Yes, yes.
-Here, come on, look here!

623
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:09,278
Look at me straight!

624
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:11,698
Listen to me. I think
that you should head back now.

625
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:14,409
-'Kay.
-Or you will regret it.

626
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:18,287
You know, when things are really hard,
you might not wanna do anything

627
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:20,540
that'll make it
more difficult for yourself.

628
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:21,708
-Isn't that right?
-Mm-hmm.

629
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:24,085
Here.

630
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:27,922
Yeah, the cab, the cab.
Here, here, here. Get in.

631
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,173
This will take me home?

632
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:32,301
Oh, of course. This will take you
right to your home. Mm-hmm.

633
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:34,470
I'll see you tomorrow!

634
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:40,101
When tomorrow comes,
you're gonna thank me for sure.

635
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:42,061
You know,

636
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:45,898
one of the worst things
a human being can go through

637
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:48,276
is the pain of embarrassment.

638
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,279
One-point-five billion?

639
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:53,322
Hey, why would you tell him that?

640
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:55,616
Her security deposit
is also all from a loan.

641
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,243
So that's why, you know?

642
00:33:57,326 --> 00:34:00,329
Doing good deeds is good, but please do
other work that will bring money too.

643
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:03,207
She's the head of our household.

644
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,084
She says she'll cover 70%.

645
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:10,840
Oh, what are you worried about?
We make enough money to get by, right?

646
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:13,051
Mmm, no, that's not it.

647
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:18,890
Would it be okay if I lived with you two?
It would just make everything easier.

648
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:20,099
Oh! Good idea.

649
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:22,268
We have three rooms, so we could do that.

650
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:24,187
Well, I guess so.

651
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:26,856
I…

652
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,359
…am really good at cleaning.

653
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:32,070
And I'm great at cooking too.

654
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,325
Is that so?

655
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:43,873
Hmm, look at this.
You still have feelings for me, right?

656
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:45,249
So how's this gonna go?

657
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,543
Well, feelings are just feelings.

658
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:49,962
I won't do anything to you.

659
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,799
It'd be nice. Just think about it.

660
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:56,010
I'm notifying my landlord.

661
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:57,762
Hmm.

662
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:02,433
A picture is worth a thousand words.

663
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:04,685
I'm glad I didn't tell you I was coming.

664
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,731
Mmm, uh, Eun-jung.

665
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:10,817
Uh, what are you doing here?

666
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,151
What brought me here

667
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:14,487
was the high-speed train,
then I followed you.

668
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:17,698
Just because we're a weekend couple,
I can't see you on the weekday?

669
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:21,244
We've been dating for seven years.
We're basically married.

670
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:23,204
Sung-ho, is this true?

671
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:26,165
Eun-jung, hey, let's go outside and talk--

672
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:29,794
No, I don't want to! I followed you here.
I'm pathetic, not ashamed.

673
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:32,797
Who are you?

674
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,714
Me?

675
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:35,925
Eun-jung, hey!

676
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:38,928
I'm a lawyer who works with him,
and this is my friend.

677
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:43,516
You told me you work with a man.

678
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:49,272
-What are you to Sung-ho?
-Uh, there's nothing between us.

679
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:51,774
There's nothing between you,
and you hold his hand like that?

680
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:53,651
Are all women in Seoul like this?

681
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:56,487
-You girls are so loose.
-Um, what'd you say?

682
00:35:56,571 --> 00:36:00,491
-Eun-jung!
-Excuse me. You better watch your tone.

683
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:03,494
-Don't insult my friend like that.
-Why can't I insult her?

684
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:06,289
-She's the one my man cheated on me with.
-No, I'm not!

685
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:08,708
Eun-jung, what are you doing?
You're embarrassing me!

686
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:11,460
-Come outside!
-What are you doing? I should be upset!

687
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:13,629
Wait a minute.

688
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:14,755
Be honest with me.

689
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,132
Is she telling the truth?

690
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:18,134
You've been together for that long?

691
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:19,552
Ooh, that's, uh…

692
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:23,014
Uh, excuse me,

693
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:25,850
but the truth is your boyfriend
is the one who has wronged you.

694
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:28,644
Even if he's cheated on you,
it's sickening that you're blaming her

695
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:30,938
and taking it out on her
instead of your boyfriend.

696
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:34,901
Hey, that's enough, okay?
Eun-jung, I'm sorry, okay?

697
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:38,446
We shouldn't do this here. Let's go.

698
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:40,448
-This is all part of being in love.
-Ah, let go!

699
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:42,408
-Why are you dragging me out?
-Come on!

700
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:44,327
Come out!

701
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:49,540
-Let go of me!
-You shouldn't be like this.

702
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,877
Just say that you don't wanna be with me.

703
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,003
Why did you lie?

704
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:56,130
What? You work with a man?

705
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,382
-Busy on weekends?
-I've been busy!

706
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:00,676
We were just having a drink
for the first time in a while.

707
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,470
And the hand-holding earlier?

708
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:06,974
It's a misunderstanding.
All right? You've misunderstood.

709
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:10,061
What are you saying?
Then why didn't you tell her about us?

710
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:14,023
And "I love you, heart, heart,"
who was that?

711
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:15,233
Come on, Eun-jung!

712
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:19,862
Did you look at my messages?

713
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:23,241
Do you know
how many times I drank with him,

714
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:24,992
to comfort him after a breakup?

715
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:28,663
How did I not catch on for three years?

716
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:30,748
Even you couldn't know everything.

717
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:32,917
Even monkeys can fall from trees.

718
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,878
Well, okay. What I didn't know
is what I didn't know.

719
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:39,257
But this asshole had the guts
to get me to introduce my friend to him?

720
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:42,260
You can't.
You can't beat him up, okay?

721
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:44,345
You'll still work, right?

722
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:47,974
-What?
-With Sung-ho, I mean.

723
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:50,810
You'll keep working, right?

724
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:53,813
Are you asking if we're still gonna be
colleagues even after this went down?

725
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:59,360
I'm sorry.

726
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:01,988
I didn't know he was that kind of guy.

727
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:03,823
But you see?

728
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:06,617
Men simply cannot be trusted at all.

729
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:08,869
Even one who is a……good one.

730
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,956
Even if it's my friend,
you can never trust men.

731
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:14,000
No exceptions.

732
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:15,334
But do lawyers

733
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:18,587
get paid unemployment?

734
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:21,549
Ah! Oh, don't worry about the money.

735
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:23,301
I'm a lawyer. Cha-ching!

736
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:25,845
You think I can't make money?

737
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:26,762
You're right.

738
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:30,558
<i>I was never this affected</i>
<i>even when I dated a jerk.</i>

739
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:33,227
<i>I lost my only male friend today.</i>

740
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:36,897
<i>The last hope I had on men…</i>
<i>vanished just like that.</i>

741
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:37,815
CLAIM FOR DAMAGE

742
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:40,359
If you withdraw from the show,
you'll be liable

743
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:43,571
to pay for the current production costs
at 7.9 billion won

744
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:45,197
and any additional costs of the reshoot.

745
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:47,450
If Mr. Nam Kang-ho
wouldn't agree to a reshoot,

746
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:50,328
you'll have to pay separately
for any resulting damage.

747
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:52,747
She's not dropping out!

748
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,373
A shoot can be delayed…

749
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:56,417
…due to an actress's health reasons.

750
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,586
If a shoot is delayed
without a doctor's note,

751
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:00,046
you may be sued for damages.

752
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:03,507
Right now, I simply can't see
Mr. Nam Kang-ho face-to-face

753
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:05,843
because of the mental shock
I had suffered.

754
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:09,680
I heard that from my friends,
but Nam Kang-ho is totally two-faced.

755
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:13,309
On camera, he acts like he's nice,
but he's really cruel when he's not.

756
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:17,021
If what you just said gets released,
it'd be spreading false information,

757
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:19,774
and it's grounds for a defamation lawsuit.

758
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:22,109
It's not false information.
I swear I heard it.

759
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:25,446
Do you think the public will believe you?
They gave him the titles

760
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:27,948
of "The Angel of Good Deeds,"
"Mr. Heartwarming."

761
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,992
Will they believe
this ten-year top star actor,

762
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:31,744
or do you think
they'd believe Hwang Ji-hye,

763
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:34,372
who's only done two projects
and is amassing anti-fans?

764
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:35,498
What?

765
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:38,042
As of today,
your anti-fan base has reached…

766
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:40,586
…27,368 members.

767
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:42,797
Oh, that's
three more than yesterday.

768
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,549
Therefore, we hereby inform you
that the burden of pausing production

769
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:48,636
vests solely on Ms. Hwang Ji-hye
and that Mr. Nam Kang-ho

770
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:51,055
is completely unrelated
to the matter at issue.

771
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:52,390
-Yeah.
-Yep.

772
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:55,684
Go back to the shoot.
It's all because you were being difficult.

773
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:57,812
You're the one
who got my hopes up, Mr. Yoon.

774
00:39:57,895 --> 00:39:59,397
You told me I would get a good deal!

775
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,856
How dare you talk to me like this!

776
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,400
-Come on.
-You're making me look bad!

777
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:04,443
-You told me to do that.
-Take her out of here!

778
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:06,237
GILMU
LAW CORPORATION

779
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:10,074
Mr. Do is amazing, huh?

780
00:40:10,157 --> 00:40:11,951
He prepared evidence
for a situation like this.

781
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:13,494
-Gilmu!
-I know, right?

782
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:16,831
If you keep this up,
I'll find a new law firm!

783
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:26,715
Hi! You're here.

784
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:35,099
Ms. Choi is rather… agitated.

785
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:36,976
Hmm?

786
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,520
I only said that if she leaves her home

787
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:42,064
without a valid reason, it'd be
disadvantageous for her divorce.

788
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:45,192
That's why I'm asking you to make it
so I don't have to deal with that!

789
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:50,156
How could you assign me
a young boy who's not even been married?

790
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:51,365
Get me another lawyer.

791
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:55,536
Mr. Ko, how about you personally
take care of Ms. Choi on your own?

792
00:40:57,705 --> 00:41:00,666
Of course.
I'll be looking into your case,

793
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:02,668
but shouldn't there be
another designated lawyer?

794
00:41:02,751 --> 00:41:06,338
Oh, no. I can't communicate with a man.
Get me a female lawyer.

795
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:09,925
But, madam, there's no female lawyer here.

796
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:13,304
If you don't get me one, I'll have to tell
Mr. Do to take our business elsewhere.

797
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:15,681
Ah, come on. You've gotta be kidding me.

798
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:18,726
We don't have one just yet.
We just have to hire one.

799
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:21,770
However, I'm not sure,

800
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:25,107
would that new hire
even live up to your standards? Hmm?

801
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:27,109
Call me when you have interviews.
I wanna sit in.

802
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,612
-I'm leaving.
-Oh, madam.

803
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:32,531
Take care and have a nice da--

804
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:37,995
Oh gosh, she drives me crazy!

805
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:40,206
Damn it!

806
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:43,626
-What are you gonna do?
-Of course we'll have to hire one.

807
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:46,587
She's a huge client.
She brings in billions to us.

808
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:48,797
A woman.

809
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:50,049
She'll be a headache.

810
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:52,259
They take menstruation leave
and maternity leave.

811
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:54,345
They complain about discrimination
and inequality.

812
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:56,805
Imagine if they had to join the army too.

813
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:58,557
Ah!

814
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:00,518
Could there be one who's ex-military?

815
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:02,686
<i>Wow, look at the view!</i>

816
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:04,772
<i>Oh, wow, that's so amazing.</i>

817
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:08,192
<i>It… it's beautiful, huh?</i>

818
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:12,112
Will she live on the window?
Everyone's saying, "The view, the view!"

819
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:15,491
-That's enough. For crying out loud.
-<i>It's really amazing in person.</i>

820
00:42:15,574 --> 00:42:17,368
Here. This is the living room.

821
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:20,371
And over there, do you see the kitchen?

822
00:42:20,454 --> 00:42:22,790
Oh, it's really huge.

823
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:26,627
Wow, and this is… Na-eun's room.

824
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:27,545
Do you see her?

825
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:30,381
<i>-Na-eun, say hi.</i>
<i>-Hello, Mr. Yeo.</i>

826
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:34,927
Ah, now I'll show you Mi-ran's room, 'kay?

827
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:40,015
<i>Huh?</i>

828
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:42,643
Are you going out?

829
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:44,812
Uh, to work.

830
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:48,399
-Right now?
-I have a lot to do.

831
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:49,775
I'll see you when I'm back.

832
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:50,776
<i>-Hang up.</i>
Hey.

833
00:42:51,443 --> 00:42:52,611
Come on, say hi.

834
00:42:56,615 --> 00:42:58,284
I said hi to him earlier.

835
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:01,620
Hurry up and tell him,
"Come over after we unpack." Here.

836
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:06,208
<i>Come over after we unpack.</i>

837
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:07,710
It's fine. I've seen it all.

838
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:10,879
Why do you talk to her like that?

839
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:13,424
Mmm.

840
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:18,053
You should be proud that she's earning
enough to live on her own, okay?

841
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:21,724
Oh, Mom, please go home.
Come back when we're unpacked.

842
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:23,392
What's there to unpack?

843
00:43:23,475 --> 00:43:25,978
Hey, mister, mister!
You can't put that there.

844
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:27,396
Not there!

845
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:30,482
Be careful with it.
I'll show you where things go.

846
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:32,901
And these over there and in there.

847
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:35,487
Hey, take it easy.
I'll do it when I get back here.

848
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:37,698
-Good luck.
-This in that room.

860
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:30,876
Hey, Ms. Lawyer.

861
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:34,421
What are you doing here?

862
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:38,759
What do I do?

863
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:40,719
I guess I'm not as good as I thought.

864
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:42,179
I'm just a fraud then, huh?

865
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:47,226
Things didn't go well?

866
00:44:47,309 --> 00:44:49,103
Mmm. Probably not.

867
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:53,148
There are plenty of law firms out there,
and I'm sure you'll get a call eventually.

868
00:44:56,568 --> 00:44:58,570
But there's not many left now.

869
00:44:59,154 --> 00:45:00,823
Civil rights lawyer sounds nice,

870
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:03,492
but I only got into it
because there wasn't anywhere to go.

871
00:45:03,575 --> 00:45:06,412
I wanted to save face,
and I ran out of options.

872
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:08,664
Who cares about losing face
in front of your dad?

873
00:45:08,747 --> 00:45:10,791
I mean, sure,
you worked hard to become a lawyer

874
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:13,001
because you wanted to prove
to your dad that he's wrong.

875
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:16,255
You've been doing pretty well.
Don't beat yourself up about it.

876
00:45:17,172 --> 00:45:20,008
Oh, damn it. I should have stopped you,
not followed you.

877
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:22,386
How are we gonna pay for all this now?

878
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:24,972
Oh, don't worry about the rent.

879
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:27,266
I'll make it. It'll be okay.

880
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:31,770
I won't let you suffer,
and I know that it's hard.

881
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:35,149
There's nothing to suffer.
There'll be fewer flights next month.

882
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:38,152
They're accepting early retirement.

883
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:45,325
-Someone text you?
-Mmm.

884
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:48,078
Whoa. Even a pro
gets rejected by text now?

885
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:51,623
Ah, shit. I'm an experienced lawyer,
not a rookie.

886
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:52,624
What?

887
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:56,545
GILMU LAW CORPORATION, CONGRATULATIONS
ON PASSING THE APPLICATION REVIEW

888
00:45:58,130 --> 00:45:59,506
-Huh?
-What is it?

889
00:46:00,674 --> 00:46:02,509
What? A job?

890
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:06,889
Oh! This firm may still hire you!

891
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:09,475
Jin-suh works there.

892
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:12,728
-The bully firm.
-Oh.

893
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:18,150
But what do I say?

894
00:46:19,526 --> 00:46:21,653
-Why is a woman here?
-She won't get it.

895
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:29,036
-Are you Ms. Yeo Mi-ran?
-Yeah, thanks.

896
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:13,205
Why did she stare at me like that?

897
00:47:13,288 --> 00:47:14,790
She's the celebrity here.

898
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:26,051
Hello.

899
00:47:26,134 --> 00:47:27,636
Hello. How have you been?

900
00:47:31,139 --> 00:47:32,516
Oh, hello.

901
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:34,017
-Oh my God.
-Have you been well?

902
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:37,813
Oh, yes.Yes, Mr. Do.

903
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:40,065
-I'm sorry?
-Do you remember me?

904
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:43,318
Oh, of course I do.

905
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:45,445
Ji… yeon.

906
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:48,240
-Am I right?
-Yes!

907
00:47:48,323 --> 00:47:50,450
Oh, he'll treat everyone to lunch today.

908
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:52,286
Really?

909
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:53,579
Let's all go eat together.

910
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:55,664
-Ah, yes. Thank you.
-Thank you.

911
00:47:55,747 --> 00:47:56,874
-Yep.
-Ah, yes.

912
00:47:56,957 --> 00:48:00,794
I can't even think straight.

913
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:02,629
You seriously remember her?

914
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:05,090
Oh, what was her last name?

915
00:48:06,508 --> 00:48:07,676
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

916
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,261
Uh, I don't know.

917
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:10,721
Jeon Ji-yeon?

918
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:12,806
-That wasn't it.
-Hello.

919
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:15,475
Yes. Hello.

920
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:17,895
-Hi.
-<i>He's a client at this law firm?</i>

921
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:20,314
She's just trying to find herself
a mega-rich guy,

922
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:21,440
so why does she even work?

923
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:23,275
So she can bring up her status.

924
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:25,736
Because she thinks
that if she raises her value,

925
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:27,613
everyone will bid on her, right?

926
00:48:29,197 --> 00:48:30,115
<i>After all,</i>

927
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:33,285
<i>well, that's every woman's dream,</i>
<i>I suppose.</i>

928
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:37,039
<i>If he hadn't smiled like that,</i>

929
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:38,373
<i>I might not have done it.</i>
