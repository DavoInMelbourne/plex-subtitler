[reporter]<i> Yes. Yes, Ms. Choi Soo-jin.</i>

176
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:48,069
Why would she say
something like that on live TV, man?

177
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:49,570
Oh gosh.

[Won-jun sighs]

180
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,826
So it's a crime
when an old man dates a young woman,

181
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,538
and it's a romance
when an old woman dates a young guy?

182
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,957

as she studied throughout the night."

-Why are you yelling at Mom again?
-Oh, no, he wasn't yelling.

235
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:07,875
It's just that you've not shown
any interest in any of these arrangements.

236
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,210
Dad was concerned. That's all.

237
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:11,879
But why does he have to yell at you?
I'm just not interested.

Whoa, whoa, what's this?

239
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,466
How dare you raise your voice at your dad?
So disrespectful.

240
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:18,678
Come on. Why are you both
at each other over nothing?

00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,930
I'll make you something.
Eat before work, 'kay?

I have something to tell you.

243
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,186
What's this?

244
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:30,189
It's the tuition to the law school
you said you didn't want me to go to.

245
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:31,899
I said I'd pay you back.

[gasps]

249
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:46,247
A third of it was from my part-time job,
but I put some more in there for you

250
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,457
for feeding me
and letting me stay at home.

251

[Dad clears throat]

252
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,712
The reason I was against you
taking the bar exam

253
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:55,756
was because I was worried
you would waste the money and time

254
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:59,927
after all that effort. Even graduates
from top law schools fail the bar exam.

255
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,679
[sighs] So I'll be moving.

256
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:03,931
You're gonna be director then? [laughs]

257
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:07,184
There's only two of you at the firm.
One's CEO, and the other's director?

258
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:10,646
No, I mean I'm moving out of here.
I'll be living on my own from now on.

259
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:14,942
-What is she saying right now?
-Huh?

260
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,361
She said she'll move out.

261
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:21,365
You disapprove whatever I do anyway.
There's no point telling you.

262
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,909
Mom didn't know either,
so don't you yell at her.

263
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,161
See you later.

264
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:26,787
Hey, stay for breakfast.

265
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,956
I'm gonna be late.
I'll see you later, okay?

266
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,040
[Mom sighs]

267
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:34,837
It won't be long
before she's saying goodbye forever.

268
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,631
Why didn't you tell me?
You must have known about this!

269
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:42,178
I told you not to yell at her!
If you must, just yell at me!

270
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:45,181
Why must you yell at Mom, huh?
Because she's easy to pick on?

271
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,224
-You rude little--
-Oh, what's the matter with you?

272
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:48,309
Go to work, okay?

273
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:52,772
Be careful, sweetie. Get something to eat
when you get to work, all right?

274
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:56,525
This country is a total mess
because of lawyers like you! Huh?

275
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,445
He took out a loan
worth 40 million in your name.

276
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:01,989
He spent 20 to buy a car
and saved the rest.

277
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:04,450
But then, he sold that car
and made another ten.

278
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:07,411
He made 30 per car loan.
There are 29 cases altogether.

279
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:10,456
That means there are
29 folks just like you.

280
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:13,417
But wait, how did he get a 40-mil loan
to buy a car that costs 20?

281
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,002
And with a young guy's name?

282
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:18,297
There's an insider at the finance firm
who adjusts the credit limit.

283
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,965
That person and the pimp are in cahoots.

284
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,759
[sighs] That son of a bitch.

285
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:24,220
[tearfully] I really don't know
anything about this.

286
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,514
He told me that he'd pay me
four million a month

287
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:27,640
if I let him use my name.

288
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:31,977
After the first payment,
he hasn't received anything for a year.

289
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,729
He really doesn't know
anything, Detective.

290
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:34,814
[sighs]

291
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,983
Honestly, I didn't know
that guy would do this to me.

292
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,568
[breathing shakily]

293
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,403
And I was so nice to him.

294
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:43,656
This is so unfair.

295
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:48,160
Hey. Don't worry.
I won't let you take the fall for this.

296
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:51,121
-I wanna kill him.
-Of course you do.

297
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,915
They were wrong for that.

298
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:55,626
I'm gonna catch him and kill him.

299
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:57,461
You can't actually kill him.

300
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:05,803
Detective Lee will catch him for sure.
His nickname is "God's Right Hand."

[sighs] You met him at a boxing gym.

303
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:12,518
How could you have let this happen to you?

304
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:14,979
We met at a boxing gym too.
Should I not be trusting you?

305
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:16,313
Hey, you, listen.

I got you.
The food's getting cold, so eat it!

Ugh, this place is so damn far away. Man!

324
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,278
We good?

325
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:07,489
[Kang-ho] Dude, is it cute
for a grown woman to act like that?

326
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,409
She just lost everything.
She'd be so miserable

327
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:13,454
she'd want to kill herself. Now she acts
like this 'cause of the nice view?

328
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:16,206
-Romance writers are all psychos, huh?
-Oh, yeah?

329
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:19,001
And she's clumsy too.
Why would anyone like her?

330
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,586
Her character's the worst,

331
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:22,421
but then everybody starts to think

332
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:24,590
that when she speaks up,
she has conviction.

then just stop watching.

00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:29,553
[yelps]

336
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:30,638
[Won-jun] Let's go.

337
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,307
-Huh?
-The rehearsal.

338
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:35,351
[sighs]

339
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,731
I'm the one who's miserable, 'kay?

340
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:41,649
Come on, man.

341
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:46,946
An action or a film noir role
would be a nice change. I'm sick of this.

342
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:49,281
Oh, go ahead and do it
if you get an offer.

343
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,783
-Hello.
-Oh, hello. Yes.

344
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:52,451
[woman 1] Wow, he's so handsome.

345
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:56,205
Hey, but if you take on those projects,
you'll wind up injured and traumatized.

346
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:57,706
And you won't get commercials.

347
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,625
-[women] Hello.
-[chuckles] Hello.

348
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,210
-[woman 2] Yes.
-Have you eaten?

349
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,670
-Yeah.
-[woman 3] He's so charming!

350
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:04,213
Commercials? Ugh!

351
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,298
You're such an opportunist. [scoffs]

352
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:10,469
Okay. Let's just stay off
romance for a while then.

353
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,388
It'd be nice to rest a bit.

354
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:13,681
-[woman 4] Hello.
-Hello.

355
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,809
-Oh! [chuckles] Oh, hey, hello.
-[women] Hello.

356
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:18,894
-We meet again on this project.
-[laughing]

357
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,230
-Let's do this!
-Yeah. [laughs]

358
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:22,940
[sighs dreamily]

359
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,318
That guy should have been
an actor himself.

360
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,821
He did try once,
but he was really bad at acting.

361
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:31,615
Ah. So God didn't give him everything.

362
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:34,118
[Won-jun] Okay,
you're the "Master of Kiss,"

363
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:35,828
so why don't we show them how it's done?

364
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:38,914
But it can't just be a kiss.
it has to be sensual.

365
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,582
[inhales sharply, exhales]

366
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,209
[romantic music playing]

367
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,305
Don't close your eyes.

368
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,891
What? Was there a line here?

369
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,018
An ad-lib.

370
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:02,855
Oh! That was good.
Hey, I think my heart just skipped a beat.

371
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:05,190
-[chuckles]
-Wow, you've really gotten better.

372
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:06,108
Not bad, man.

373
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,861
And that thing you just said,
"Don't close your eyes," or something,

374
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:10,738
ask the director to add
that in no matter what.

375
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:11,739
Hmm.

376
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:15,659
And also, don't turn
and bring your face in close like this.

377
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,995
Instead, wrap your arm
around the waist and pull her in.

378
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,415
So if you wrap your arm
around her waist and pull her in,

379
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:24,626
the girl will be in this position,
so when she tries to pull her head away,

380
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:28,088
she'll naturally just…
fall back on the couch.

381
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:29,298
-You see?
-Oh.

382
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:30,299
Okay.

383
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,719
-Yeah. All right, get in the mood. Here.
-Yeah.

384
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:35,679
Ready and action.

385
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:38,098
[breathes deeply]

386
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:42,936
[romantic music playing]

387
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:58,619
Don't close your eyes.

388
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:07,461
[moans]

389
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,511
[groaning]

390
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:18,764
-Whoa! Ah, shit!
-[laughing]

391
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:21,058
-Damn.
-That was my bad. [laughing]

392
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:24,144
-That was on purpose.
-Huh? Bro, I just fell over.

393
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:25,896
-Oh jeez.
-[laughs] Hey, wait.

394
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:27,272
That was our first kiss.

395
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,483
-[gasps]
-[Won-jun] What are you saying, nutjob?

396
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:30,943
-Get off me.
-Oh, wait.

397
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:32,945
-Damn it, get off!
-Hold on. Okay.

398
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:34,238
[both grunting]

399
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:36,698
I'm… I'm sorry.

400
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,368
Hey! Why are you sorry?
Where are you going? Where are you going?

401
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:42,371
Hey, we're rehearsing here.
Rehearsing the scene!

402
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:43,330
[sighs deeply]

403
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:46,458
-Jeez.
-[Won-jun] Why are you shocked?

404
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,001
What's up with the sigh of relief?

405
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,253
[chuckles]

406
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:51,380
I'm not doing this.
You practice with him from now on.

407
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:53,090
Come on, why are you so grossed out?

408
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:55,008
[scoffs]

409
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:56,176
Well, um…

410
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:59,221
Oh, yeah, why are you here?

411
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:01,640
They say the shoot
will be delayed for a bit,

412
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:05,102
so you should relax and wait here.
Or take a nap or something, yeah?

413
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:07,771
[Won-jun] What?
That means we won't finish today.

414
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,314
It's Hwang Ji-hye, am I right?

415
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:10,232
[door closes]

416
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,404
[gasps] What's all this?

417
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:17,739
Bonus for winning the case.

418
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,659
-Huh?
-I'd say this is better, yeah?

419
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:24,163
We probably couldn't sell
that empty lot we got last time.

420
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:27,332
How can this be better?
What will you do with these?

421
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,751
I'll… eat them. You'll eat them.

422
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:33,255
We'll give them away
and donate them. [sighs]

423
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:36,091
There wouldn't be a way
to sell all these, right?

424
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,635
Ah! Seung-gu has a truck.
Maybe we can borrow it?

425
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:41,096
-Oh, really? Good idea.
-[phone vibrating]

426
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:43,223
[gasps]

427
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:45,893
Hey, Seung-gu.
We were actually just talking about you.

428
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:48,729
[Seung-gu]<i> Mi-ran, those assholes</i>
<i>are partying in Jindo.</i>

429
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:51,190
<i>-I'm going there to catch them.</i>
-What are you doing?

430
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:53,692
-You there? Huh?
-[line beeping]

431
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:55,485
What's wrong? He asked for money?

432
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,404
Seung-gu says he's on his way
to catch the pimp.

433
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,239
-Where?
-Jindo.

434
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:00,157
Where in Jindo?

435
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,286
I wanna kill him.
I'm gonna catch him and kill him.

436
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:05,495
[gasps]

437
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:08,415
[gasps] Sung-ho,
call the police right away.

438
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:09,666
-Do it!
-Oh, sure.

439
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,503
[Sung-ho]<i> I just got a call</i>
<i>from Detective Lee.</i>

440
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:15,088
<i>They're in Sol Beach Resort.</i>

441
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:17,174
<i>The room is booked under</i>
<i>the pimp's younger brother.</i>

442
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:18,842
Did he call the authorities in Jindo?

443
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,260
[Sung-ho]<i> Yeah, he said he did.</i>

444
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:22,179
-Okay, thank you.
-[phone beeps off]

445
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,057
Oh, Seung-gu.

446
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,226
Seung-gu, please don't cause any trouble.

447
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:28,143
[sighs]

448
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:31,855
-[sighs] Please don't cause any trouble.
-I'll be fine.

449
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:34,107
-[elevator dings]
-[woman] Mr. Do! [panting]

450
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,526
-I… I'm…
-What's up?

451
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:39,655
-I'm sorry, but I need your help.
-Huh?

452
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:42,866
She may not listen to the director,
but she may listen to another actor.

453
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,743
What is the issue?

454
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:48,455
[director] I mean… [scoffs]
You're saying that the reason

455
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:52,042
you won't put on makeup is you might get
an ad offer from other brands?

456
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:55,671
As soon as the show comes out,
I'm sure that I'll get an offer.

457
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,091
See, if I were to use
another brand's makeup during the show,

458
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:00,759
what would the advertiser say?

459
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:04,388
How about this?
I could just get my hair touched up.

460
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:07,391
-Do I have to use makeup?
-Okay, okay.

461
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:10,477
See, there haven't been
any beauty offers just yet.

462
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,604
And I have a scene to shoot.

463
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:15,357
We've also managed to obtain sponsorship,

464
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,776
so you'll have to work with us on this.

465
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:21,196
Why must I be responsible
for your sponsorship?

466
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,656
[laughs annoyedly]

467
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:24,533
It's not my responsibility either.

468
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:28,954
Do you have any idea how hard things are?
Production is losing money!

469
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:30,747
Huh? Losing money! In the red!

470
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:32,916
Can I just confirm?

471
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,752
Did you just raise your voice just then?

472
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:36,795
[breathing heavily]

473
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:38,630
I can't just stand here.

474
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:41,842
I'm the lead. When there's a delay,
I have a responsibility to the production.

475
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:44,386
The crew are on standby.
We gotta shoot the scene.

476
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,013
I agree, we do.

477
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:48,640
-But she won't open up to you.
-[scoffs]

478
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:51,018
[Won-jun] If you go there
and take one look at her face,

479
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:52,477
you think you can hold your tongue?

480
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:55,522
The moment you see her face,
you'll lose your temper.

481
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:58,066
Watching her at the beach scene,
you couldn't stand her.

482
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,235
And there you were,
going on about how awful she was.

483
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,821
I took my meds. I can hold it in.

484
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:05,532
How many times has
that medicine failed you, huh?

485
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:09,536
You drove at least ten actresses to tears
even after taking that medicine.

486
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:12,873
Then I was the only one
who cleaned up the whole mess.

487
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:15,125
I learned the hard way.

488
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:17,419
I won't let you get involved
in any situations like this.

489
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:18,337
Listen.

490
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,715
I won't mess up this time.

491
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:23,008
For once, just trust me.

492
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:25,260
No, no. I won't fall for it.

493
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,970
-No way.
-Just once, man.

494
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:30,015
-No casualties.
-[Won-jun] What do you mean?

495
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:31,600
-Where are you going?
-[Kang-ho] Thanks.

496
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,560
-Thanks for what?
-[Kang-ho] You're the best.

497
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:35,145
Hey, you don't wanna do that.

498
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:37,272
-[Kang-ho] Yeah, thanks.
-Hey!

499
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:41,485
-[grunts]

00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:12,159
Kang-ho. I'm sorry about all this.

532
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:14,244
It's all right. I'm here to talk to her.

533
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:21,334
Ji-hye, I'm sure there's
a reason why you're acting this way.

534
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:23,795
There's something I wanna share
from my years in the industry.

535
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,380
Would you like to hear me out?

536
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:30,093
As you can see,
we are really lucky to work here.

537
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:34,139
The director's nice, and there're
no last-minute script changes.

538
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:36,141
This script was finalized a week ago.

539
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:39,144
So, let's just go with this one.

540
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:41,188
The crew are all waiting on us.

541
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:42,105
Okay?

543
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:45,942
This is how it is.

544
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,861
We just make do and shoot.

545
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:49,696
What do you think?

546
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:51,615
Huh?

[whines softly]

548
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:57,871
But, Kang-ho, this is different.

549
00:24:58,371 --> 00:24:59,539
This is a scene

550
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:01,416
where the director said

551
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,252
I'm supposed to be getting pretty
so I can go on a date with a guy.

552
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:06,713
So I came up with an idea.

553
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:08,673
Instead of putting on makeup,

554
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:11,343
I was thinking maybe
something like this would help.

555
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:13,512
[squeaks]

556
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:14,763

[whines softly]

558
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,849
Or this. [inhales sharply]

559
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:19,976
And… [giggles]

560
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,395
Or a cute smile like this? [giggles]

00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:26,858
[Kang-ho]<i> Cheap flirting</i>
<i>shows that you have no class.</i>

562
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:31,029
Or maybe… sexy could work.

[provocative music playing]

564
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:34,533

[chiming]

566
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:37,494
Just like that.

567
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:43,500
I'll pretend to tie back my hair
and show him the nape of my neck.

568
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:47,128
[Kang-ho]<i> Again, it's cheap, not sexy.</i>
<i>Please stop.</i>

Ji-hye! Huh?

573
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:00,392
What are you doing? Hurry.

574
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:02,352
-Ji-hye! Just talk to me.
-Hey, stop!

575
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:04,020
Ji-hye, stop running!

-Oh no, she's leaving!

-Hurry!

-You're really annoying me right now.
-[engine starts]

580
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:13,113
Ji-hye, please open up, 'kay?

581
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:16,032
Open the door.
Oh my gosh, stop! Oh, come on.

582
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:18,618
What do we do now?
She can't just leave like this!

583
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:20,704
-What do we do?
-[crying]

584
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:22,831
-Ah, what do we do?
-Why does this happen to me?

585
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,583
[groans] She's really-- Oh jeez!

586
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,793
-But still there's a chance.
-I don't know. Call her!

Bro, I didn't say anything. I swear.

and we should just go with the script.

[intriguing music playing]

593
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:42,809
And somehow she stormed out
looking that angry?

594
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:46,396
Well, of course she was acting ridiculous,
so she might have seen it on my face.

595
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:48,648
But I wasn't being mean to her
or anything, dude!

Don't they have them inside?

I would have just said
what I was thinking.

00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,410
Hey, are you an actress?

602
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:02,662
-Are you in this just for commercials?
-[groans]

603
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:06,207
You won't get any commercial contracts.
You know why?

I guess we'll part here.

You really helped me out. Thank you.

She's just trying to find herself
a mega-rich guy,

621
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:48,500
so why does she even work?

622
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:50,710
So she can bring up her status.

623
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:54,964
Because she thinks
that if she raises her value,

624
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:56,758
everyone will bid on her, right?

It's kind of a psychopath type, you know?

They win the hearts of women,
then they live off that energy

648

yet think women are worthless
and only see them as prey.

[gasps] No way. And it was him for sure?

650
00:28:58,486 --> 00:29:01,114
Yes, I checked to make sure.
Nam Kang-ho and Hwang Ji-hye

651
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:02,157

Also, even if it was out of context,
there's no way he didn't mean it.

No, it can't be true.
You must be mistaken.

[sighs] How much do you know about men?
You always go for the handsome ones.

660
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:27,474
Do you have any idea how men talk
about women when they're alone at night?

Love? I don't think so.

662
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:31,978
Women are just for sex,
and they're objects for ownership.

663
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:34,063
When their girlfriends dump them,
they watch porn!

664
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:36,065
Porn! They use it to comfort each other.
No joke!

665
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:39,778
And they also feel superior
as if they can toy with women's hearts.

666
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:41,613
They're just a bunch
of assholes by nature.

667
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:44,240
They cower before those who are strong
and trample on the weak.

668
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:46,951
And all they want to do is
to categorize women as the weaker sex.

-Not all men are like that, you know.

00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:56,085
I know, why'd you dump him?
He's a rare breed.

672
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:57,754
And he's actually kinda cute too.

673
00:29:57,837 --> 00:29:59,839
Did I date him?
What do you mean, I dumped him?

674
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:02,425
Oh gosh. Hey, Na-eun, it's been a while.

675
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:03,676
How have you been?

676
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,721
-[Sung-ho] Excuse me. I'd like one too.
-[server] Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

677
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:09,557
Wow, the subordinate gets off work early
and is drinking,

678
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:12,852
and the boss stays and finishes work.
What a dream job you have.

679
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:14,646
[laughs] Oh, come on.

680
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:18,399
Mi-ran has to work so much
because money's so tight.

681
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:21,903
Hey, do you know
who wants to buy potatoes or useless land?

682
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:23,947
What do you mean?

683
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:24,989
Don't say it.

684
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:27,659
We got paid
with potatoes and an empty lot.

685
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:29,661
Huh? They didn't pay you the fees?

686
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,330
[Mi-ran sighs] It's not like that.

687
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:34,541
Sung-ho made the deal
right from the beginning.

688
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:36,376
-Oh, here!
-[server] Here's your beer.

689
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:38,795
Mi-ran and Na-eun,
congrats on your freedom, huh?

690
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,505
I wish you good luck!

691
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:42,715
Yeah, thank you very… munch.

692
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:46,511
-[Mi-ran, Na-eun laugh]
-[Sung-ho laughs awkwardly]

693
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:47,929
Where are you?

694
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,807
You still with the director?

695
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:53,434
Yeah. Don't worry about me, okay?

696
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:54,853
Sorry, bro.

697
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:56,688
Good night.

698
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:57,981
-[Kang-ho] <i>Okay</i>.
-Yeah.

699
00:30:58,857 --> 00:30:59,732
[phone beeps off]

700
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:01,150
[sighs]

701
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:06,698
[drunkenly] Look, Kang-ho is
really, really worried about you.

702
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:07,866
He's worried sick.

703
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:10,285
You know what he said earlier?

704
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:12,161
Kang-ho wants to cheer you up.

705
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:14,539
-Aw, Kang-ho is so great!
-[Won-jun laughing]

706
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:16,875
[laughing] Oh, thank you so much.

707
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,544
I know you must be very busy, Mr. Do.

708
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:20,879
Oh, you see, I'm just…

709
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:23,756
-I'm just doing my job, you know.
-[sighs]

710
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,093
It's been so long since we've been able
to share drinks together.

711
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:29,762
-And it just makes me really happy.
-[both laughing]

712
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:31,806
-I mean it!
-Oh yeah, by the way…

713
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:36,644
It was Hwang Ji-hye who caused
all that trouble. She hasn't called once.

714
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:40,356
Because of her, I'm so upset. [crying]

715
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,109
Oh, wow. This must be so hard for you.

716
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:46,988
I'm sure Ji-hye
is also feeling very sorry right now.

717
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:50,366
Don't worry about it.
You know, I will talk with her soon,

718
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:54,454
and… I'll make sure the show goes on!

719
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:56,372
-[gasps] Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

720
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:58,625
I'm really counting on you, Mr. Do.

721
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:00,501
Leave it to me. [grunts]

722
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:03,004
-[baby toy squeaks]
-Whoa, whoa, hey. Wait, wait, wait!

723
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:05,632
What do you think you're doing?
You're already so drunk.

724
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:08,468
Why? Let's go somewhere
and have another drink!

725
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:09,636
[sighs]

726
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:12,096
-Goodbye! Have a good night.
-[Won-jun] Okay, get home safely.

727
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,556
Okay, have a good night.

728
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,936
-[moaning]
-[grunting]

729
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:19,187
Oh, thanks a lot!

730
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,981
-Hey, are you okay?
-Oh, yeah. I'm good.

731
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:25,109
Just hang in there.
Your cab is almost here.

732
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,695
Mr. Do, you know, I'm…

733
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:30,490
I'm really stressed.

734
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:34,911
I get pushed and tossed around,
and I'm so stressed.

735
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:36,371
[sighs]

736
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:37,497
Okay.

737
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:40,541
I know, I know. You're in the middle,
getting pushed around,

738
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:43,294
and you do have the toughest job.
I know that, really.

739
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:46,631
[laughing] That's why
we should have another drink.

740
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:47,882
Just one more.

741
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:50,051
-One more drink!
-Oh, wow. Look.

742
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:54,389
-Oh, look at the time. It's late.
-Oh, come on, please!

743
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:57,141
One more drink.
There's a place right here. If I buy--

744
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:59,602
-[retches]
-Huh? Whoa, whoa, whoa. W… wait. Hey.

745
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:01,980
I'm fine.

746
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:03,648
-You good?
-Yep. [gulps]

747
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:04,607
You swallowed it?

748
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:07,026
-Yes, yes.
-Here, come on, look here!

749
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:09,237
-Look at me straight!
-[moans]

750
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,656
Listen to me. I think
that you should head back now.

751
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:14,367
-'Kay.
-Or you will regret it.

752
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:18,246
You know, when things are really hard,
you might not wanna do anything

753
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:20,498
that'll make it
more difficult for yourself.

754
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:21,666
-Isn't that right?
-Mm-hmm.

755
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:23,042
[car horn honks]

756
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:24,043
Here.

757
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:27,880
Yeah, the cab, the cab.
Here, here, here. Get in.

758
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:29,132
This will take me home?

759
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:32,260
Oh, of course. This will take you
right to your home. Mm-hmm.

760
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:34,429
I'll see you tomorrow!

761
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:40,059
When tomorrow comes,
you're gonna thank me for sure.

762
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:42,020
You know,

763
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:45,857
one of the worst things
a human being can go through

764
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:48,234
is the pain of embarrassment.

765
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:51,237
-One-point-five billion?
-[cash register rings]

766
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,281
Hey, why would you tell him that?

767
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:55,575
Her security deposit
is also all from a loan.

768
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:57,201
So that's why, you know?

769
00:33:57,285 --> 00:34:00,288
Doing good deeds is good, but please do
other work that will bring money too.

770
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:03,166
[sighs] She's the head of our household.

771
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:05,043
She says she'll cover 70%.

772
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:10,798
Oh, what are you worried about?
We make enough money to get by, right?

773
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:13,009
Mmm, no, that's not it.

774
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:18,848
Would it be okay if I lived with you two?
It would just make everything easier.

775
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:20,058
Oh! Good idea.

776
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:22,226
We have three rooms, so we could do that.

777
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:24,145
Well, I guess so.

778
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:26,814
I…

779
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,274
[intriguing music playing]

780
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:30,318
…am really good at cleaning.

781
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,028
And I'm great at cooking too.

782
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:37,283
Is that so?

783
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:41,245
[heart beating]

784
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:43,831
Hmm, look at this.
You still have feelings for me, right?

785
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,208
So how's this gonna go?

786
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:47,502
Well, feelings are just feelings.

787
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:49,921
I won't do anything to you.

788
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:52,757
It'd be nice. Just think about it.

789
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,968
I'm notifying my landlord.

790
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:57,720
Hmm.

791
00:34:57,804 --> 00:34:59,263
[footsteps approaching]

792
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,391
A picture is worth a thousand words.

793
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:04,644
I'm glad I didn't tell you I was coming.

794
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:07,105
[intriguing music continues]

795
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:08,689
Mmm, uh, Eun-jung.

796
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:10,775
Uh, what are you doing here?

797
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:12,110
What brought me here

798
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:14,445
was the high-speed train,
then I followed you.

799
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:17,657
Just because we're a weekend couple,
I can't see you on the weekday?

800
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:21,202
We've been dating for seven years.
We're basically married.

801
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:23,162
Sung-ho, is this true?

802
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:26,124
Eun-jung, hey, let's go outside and talk--

803
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:29,752
No, I don't want to! I followed you here.
I'm pathetic, not ashamed.

804
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:32,755
Who are you?

805
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:33,673
Me?

806
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:35,883
Eun-jung, hey!

807
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:38,886
I'm a lawyer who works with him,
and this is my friend.

808
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:39,804
[sighs]

809
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:43,474
-You told me you work with a man.
-[gasps]

810
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:49,230
-What are you to Sung-ho?
-Uh, there's nothing between us.

811
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:51,732
There's nothing between you,
and you hold his hand like that?

812
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,609
Are all women in Seoul like this?

813
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:56,445
-You girls are so loose.
-Um, what'd you say?

814
00:35:56,529 --> 00:36:00,449
-Eun-jung!
-Excuse me. You better watch your tone.

815
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:03,452
-Don't insult my friend like that.
-Why can't I insult her?

816
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:06,247
-She's the one my man cheated on me with.
-No, I'm not!

817
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,666
Eun-jung, what are you doing?
You're embarrassing me!

818
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:11,419
-Come outside!
-What are you doing? I should be upset!

819
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:13,588
Wait a minute.

820
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:14,714
Be honest with me.

821
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:16,090
Is she telling the truth?

822
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,092
You've been together for that long?

823
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,510
-Ooh, that's, uh…
-[wolf howling]

824
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:21,220
[gasping]

825
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:22,972
Uh, excuse me,

826
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:25,808
but the truth is your boyfriend
is the one who has wronged you.

827
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:28,603
Even if he's cheated on you,
it's sickening that you're blaming her

828
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:30,897
and taking it out on her
instead of your boyfriend.

829
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:34,859
Hey, that's enough, okay?
Eun-jung, I'm sorry, okay?

830
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:38,404
We shouldn't do this here. Let's go.

831
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:40,406
-This is all part of being in love.
-Ah, let go!

832
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:42,366
-Why are you dragging me out?
-[Sung-ho] Come on!

833
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,285
-[sighs]
-[Sung-ho] Come out!

834
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:49,498
-[grunts] Let go of me!
-You shouldn't be like this.

835
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:52,835
-Just say that you don't wanna be with me.
-[sighs]

836
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:53,961
Why did you lie?

837
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:56,088
What? You work with a man?

838
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:58,341
-Busy on weekends?
-I've been busy!

839
00:36:58,424 --> 00:37:00,635
We were just having a drink
for the first time in a while.

840
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:02,428
And the hand-holding earlier?

841
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:06,933
It's a misunderstanding.
All right? You've misunderstood.

842
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:10,019
What are you saying?
Then why didn't you tell her about us?

843
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:10,978
[scoffs]

844
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:13,981
And "I love you, heart, heart,"
who was that?

845
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,191
Come on, Eun-jung!

846
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:19,820
-Did you look at my messages?
-[exhales sharply]

847
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:23,199
Do you know
how many times I drank with him,

848
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:24,951
to comfort him after a breakup?

849
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:28,621
[laughs incredulously]
How did I not catch on for three years?

850
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:30,706
Even you couldn't know everything.

851
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:32,875
Even monkeys can fall from trees.

852
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:35,836
Well, okay. What I didn't know
is what I didn't know.

853
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,215
But this asshole had the guts
to get me to introduce my friend to him?

854
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:42,218
You can't. [laughs nervously]
You can't beat him up, okay?

855
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:44,303
-[sighs]
-You'll still work, right?

856
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:47,932
-What?
-With Sung-ho, I mean. [laughs nervously]

857
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:50,768
You'll keep working, right?

858
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:53,771
Are you asking if we're still gonna be
colleagues even after this went down?

859
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:54,689
[sighs]

860
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:59,318
[sighs] I'm sorry.

861
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:01,946
I didn't know he was that kind of guy.

862
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:03,781
But you see?

863
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:06,575
Men simply cannot be trusted at all.

864
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:08,828
Even one who is a… [scoffs] …good one.

865
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:11,914
Even if it's my friend,
you can never trust men.

866
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:13,958
No exceptions. [sighs]

867
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:15,293
But do lawyers

868
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:18,546
get paid unemployment?

869
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:21,507
Ah! Oh, don't worry about the money.

870
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:23,259
I'm a lawyer. Cha-ching!

871
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:25,803
-You think I can't make money?
-[laughs nervously]

872
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:26,721
You're right.

873
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:30,516
[Mi-ran]<i> I was never this affected</i>
<i>even when I dated a jerk.</i>

874
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:33,185
<i>I lost my only male friend today.</i>

875
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:36,856
<i>The last hope I had on men…</i>
<i>vanished just like that.</i>

876
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:37,773
CLAIM FOR DAMAGE

877
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:40,318
[Jin-suh] If you withdraw from the show,
you'll be liable

878
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:43,529
to pay for the current production costs
at 7.9 billion won

879
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:45,156
and any additional costs of the reshoot.

880
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:47,408
If Mr. Nam Kang-ho
wouldn't agree to a reshoot,

881
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:50,286
you'll have to pay separately
for any resulting damage.

882
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:52,705
-[sighs] She's not dropping out!
-[thunder rumbles]

883
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:54,332
-A shoot can be delayed…
-[moans]

884
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:56,375
…due to an actress's health reasons.

885
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:58,544
If a shoot is delayed
without a doctor's note,

886
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:00,004
you may be sued for damages.

887
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:03,466
Right now, I simply can't see
Mr. Nam Kang-ho face-to-face

888
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:05,801
because of the mental shock
I had suffered.

889
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:09,638
I heard that from my friends,
but Nam Kang-ho is totally two-faced.

890
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:13,267
On camera, he acts like he's nice,
but he's really cruel when he's not.

891
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:16,979
If what you just said gets released,
it'd be spreading false information,

892
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:19,732
and it's grounds for a defamation lawsuit.

893
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:22,068
It's not false information.
I swear I heard it.

894
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:25,404
Do you think the public will believe you?
They gave him the titles

895
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,907
of "The Angel of Good Deeds,"
"Mr. Heartwarming."

896
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:29,950
Will they believe
this ten-year top star actor,

897
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,702
or do you think
they'd believe Hwang Ji-hye,

898
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:34,330
who's only done two projects
and is amassing anti-fans?

899
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:35,456
[splutters] What?

900
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:38,000
As of today,
your anti-fan base has reached…

901
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:40,544
[exhales deeply] …27,368 members.

902
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:42,755
[lawyer] Oh, that's
three more than yesterday.

903
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:45,508
Therefore, we hereby inform you
that the burden of pausing production

904
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:48,594
vests solely on Ms. Hwang Ji-hye
and that Mr. Nam Kang-ho

905
00:39:48,677 --> 00:39:51,013
is completely unrelated
to the matter at issue.

906
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:52,348
-Yeah.
-Yep.

907
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:55,643
Go back to the shoot.
It's all because you were being difficult.

908
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:57,770
[Ji-hye] You're the one
who got my hopes up, Mr. Yoon.

909
00:39:57,853 --> 00:39:59,355
You told me I would get a good deal!

910
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:00,815
How dare you talk to me like this!

911
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:02,358
-Come on.
-You're making me look bad!

912
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:04,402
-You told me to do that.
-Take her out of here!

913

GILMU

[mimics mechanical whir]

915
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:10,032
[sighs] Mr. Do is amazing, huh?

916
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:11,909
He prepared evidence
for a situation like this.

917
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:13,452
-Gilmu!
-I know, right?

918
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,789
[Soo-jin] If you keep this up,
I'll find a new law firm!

919
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:21,585
[grunts]

920
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:26,674
Hi! You're here.

921
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:35,057
Ms. Choi is rather… agitated.

922
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:36,934
-[sighs]
-Hmm?

923
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:39,478
I only said that if she leaves her home

924
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:42,022
without a valid reason, it'd be
disadvantageous for her divorce.

925
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:45,151
That's why I'm asking you to make it
so I don't have to deal with that!

926
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:46,235
[sighs]

927
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:50,114
How could you assign me
a young boy who's not even been married?

928
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:51,323
Get me another lawyer.

929
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:55,494
Mr. Ko, how about you personally
take care of Ms. Choi on your own?

930
00:40:57,663 --> 00:41:00,624
[chuckles] Of course.
I'll be looking into your case,

931
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:02,626
but shouldn't there be
another designated lawyer?

932
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:06,297
Oh, no. I can't communicate with a man.
Get me a female lawyer.

933
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:09,884
But, madam, there's no female lawyer here.

934
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:13,262
If you don't get me one, I'll have to tell
Mr. Do to take our business elsewhere.

935
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:15,639
Ah, come on. You've gotta be kidding me.

936
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:18,684
We don't have one just yet.
We just have to hire one.

937
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:21,729
[sighs] However, I'm not sure,

938
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:25,065
would that new hire
even live up to your standards? Hmm?

939
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:27,067
Call me when you have interviews.
I wanna sit in.

940
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:29,570
-I'm leaving.
-Oh, madam.

941
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:32,490
Take care and have a nice da--

944
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:37,953
Oh gosh, she drives me crazy!

945
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:40,164
[groans] Damn it!

946
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:43,584
-What are you gonna do?
-Of course we'll have to hire one.

947
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:46,545
She's a huge client.
She brings in billions to us. [sighs]

948
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:48,756
A woman.

949
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:50,007
She'll be a headache.

950
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:52,218
They take menstruation leave
and maternity leave.

951
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:54,303
They complain about discrimination
and inequality.

952
00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:56,764
Imagine if they had to join the army too.

953
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:58,516
-Ah!
-[chiming]

954
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:00,476

<i>It… it's beautiful, huh?</i>

959
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:12,071
Will she live on the window?
Everyone's saying, "The view, the view!"

960
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:15,449
-That's enough. For crying out loud.
-[Mom] <i>It's really amazing in person.</i>

961
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,326
Here. This is the living room.

962
00:42:17,826 --> 00:42:20,329
And over there, do you see the kitchen?

963
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:22,748
Oh, it's really huge.

964
00:42:22,831 --> 00:42:26,585
Wow, and this is… Na-eun's room.

965
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:27,503
Do you see her?

00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,242
I said hi to him earlier.

979
00:42:58,325 --> 00:43:01,579
Hurry up and tell him,
"Come over after we unpack." Here.

It's fine. I've seen it all.

983
00:43:08,877 --> 00:43:10,838
Why do you talk to her like that?

984
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:13,382
Mmm.

985
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:18,012
You should be proud that she's earning
enough to live on her own, okay?

You can't put that there.

00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:30,441
[Mom] Be careful with it.
I'll show you where things go.

And these over there and in there.

993

Hey, take it easy.
I'll do it when I get back here.

1012

Hey, Ms. Lawyer.

1013
00:44:32,586 --> 00:44:34,380
What are you doing here?

1014

[sighs]

1015
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:38,717
What do I do?

1016
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:40,678
I guess I'm not as good as I thought.

1017
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:42,137
I'm just a fraud then, huh?

1018
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:47,184
Things didn't go well?

1019
00:44:47,267 --> 00:44:49,061
Mmm. Probably not.

1020
00:44:49,144 --> 00:44:53,107
There are plenty of law firms out there,
and I'm sure you'll get a call eventually.

[sighs, whimpers]

1022
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:58,529
But there's not many left now.

1023
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:00,781
Civil rights lawyer sounds nice,

1024
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:03,450
but I only got into it
because there wasn't anywhere to go.

1025
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:06,370
I wanted to save face,
and I ran out of options.

1026
00:45:06,453 --> 00:45:08,622
Who cares about losing face
in front of your dad?

1027
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:10,749
I mean, sure,
you worked hard to become a lawyer

1028
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:12,960
because you wanted to prove
to your dad that he's wrong.

1029
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:16,213
You've been doing pretty well.
Don't beat yourself up about it.

1030
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:19,967
Oh, damn it. I should have stopped you,
not followed you.

1031
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:22,344
How are we gonna pay for all this now?

1032
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:24,930
[sighs] Oh, don't worry about the rent.

1033
00:45:25,013 --> 00:45:27,224
I'll make it. It'll be okay.

1034
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:31,729
I won't let you suffer,
and I know that it's hard.

1035
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:35,107
There's nothing to suffer.
There'll be fewer flights next month.

-Mmm.

Whoa. Even a pro
gets rejected by text now?

1041
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:51,582
Ah, shit. I'm an experienced lawyer,
not a rookie.

Oh! This firm may still hire you!

1047

She's just trying to find herself

so why does she even work?

1090

So she can bring up her status.

1091

Because she thinks
that if she raises her value,
