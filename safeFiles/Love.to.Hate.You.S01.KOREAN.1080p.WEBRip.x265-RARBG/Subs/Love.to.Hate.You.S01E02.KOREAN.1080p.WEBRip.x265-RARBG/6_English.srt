1
00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:30,697
I'm sorry.

2
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,495
It was wrong of me.

3
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:41,207
PRESIDENT DO WON-JUN

4
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:43,668
And then?

5
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:46,755
Yeah?

6
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:50,300
If you whimsically apologize,
and I whimsically forgive you, that's it?

7
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:53,970
The director and the crew?
What about them?

8
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,180
Ah…

9
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:56,973
I'll say sorry to the others too.

10
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,850
Ah. How will you do that?

11
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,772
Mr. Yoon, what am I supposed to say?

12
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:05,815
You'd better bow down
to each and every crew member

13
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,317
the same way you just did now.

14
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:08,735
What?

15
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:16,826
<i>If you don't do as I say,</i>
<i>I'll make sure you're done for.</i>

16
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,621
BAD BOY

17
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:20,914
Did you see that look?

18
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:23,500
"If you don't do as I say,
I will end you."

19
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,085
-That's what it said.
-I know!

20
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:27,087
Now, do you see
what I've been telling you?

21
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,505
It was even worse then.

22
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:31,091
He treats the female lead this way?
"Mr. Romance?"

23
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:34,135
-I've had enough of it!
-That's what I'm saying.

24
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:37,472
That's why I did it.
You said, "Do as you please."

25
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,849
You did well.

26
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:43,853
Hey, she caused that mess herself.
She deserves this and more.

27
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:46,648
-So how did you do it?
-Do what?

28
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:47,982
I reached out to Gilmu.

29
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:51,194
And they said the production company
would probably take legal action.

30
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:53,154
Nice.

31
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:56,032
Ugh, you little…

32
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,867
What, what, what? What's wrong?

33
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:02,539
I'm embarrassed just thinking about
what the Gilmu guys would say about this.

34
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,624
You only ever pick fights
with women, seriously.

35
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:06,626
"Mr. Romance" Nam Kang-ho turns out

36
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:09,963
to be insufferably nasty and petty.
That's probably what they'll think.

37
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:13,341
And it's not like you've met
any of the lawyers over there.

38
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:15,510
They're probably gossiping like crazy.

39
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:17,512
I'm not even sure
if we can keep this a secret.

40
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:22,100
How about I… take them out to lunch today?

41
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:23,977
What?

42
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:30,441
<i>Gilmu Law Corporation.</i>

43
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,319
<i>Let me explain what they're like.</i>

44
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:36,030
There she is!
There! There she is!

45
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:41,411
Hey! Hey, wait! Okay. Okay, please…

46
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:42,328
GILMU'S ATTORNEY

47
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:44,164
Were you
aware of the plagiarism?

48
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:46,124
Tell us how you're feeling.

49
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,004
We're innocent.

50
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:55,300
Our songwriter worked hard on it
for six years.

51
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:58,469
And we've been listening to it for a…

52
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:01,181
<i>They specialize in entertainment</i>
<i>and represent celebrities.</i>

53
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:02,140
GILMU'S REPRESENTATIVE

54
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:04,392
<i>They have a clearly defined view on life.</i>

55
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,145
<i>"Kill two birds with one stone."</i>

56
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,982
<i>Party with the celebrities</i>
<i>and make money too.</i>

57
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:21,492
<i>Either they endure the shame,</i>

58
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:23,828
<i>or they just don't have any.</i>

59
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:32,253
-Welcome.
-I'm here for the interview today.

60
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:34,714
-Ah, yes. Right this way.
-I appreciate it.

61
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:36,716
-Of course. Take care.
-You're welcome.

62
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:43,348
<i>The biggest problem</i>
<i>is that this is an all-male law firm.</i>

63
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:47,268
<i>They do not hire female lawyers.</i>

64
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:50,063
-Why is a woman here?
-She can't get the job.

65
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:56,319
-Are you Ms. Yeo Mi-ran?
-Yeah.

66
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,657
<i>I know</i>
<i>they called me back as a formality.</i>

67
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,034
<i>And I'm here despite knowing that.</i>

68
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:05,036
<i>I'm that desperate right now.</i>

69
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:08,790
<i>The odds may be terrible,</i>
<i>but I can't help taking the chance.</i>

70
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:33,481
Why are they all men?
I only saw one woman out there.

71
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:35,483
Uh, yeah, I know.

72
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:39,279
Uh, maybe they think we only hire men.

73
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,864
You should've said
female candidates only.

74
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,826
No. No way. We couldn't post that.

75
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,953
Oh jeez.

76
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:48,913
Uh, what was her last name?

77
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:51,541
I don't know.

78
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,293
Was it Jang Ji-yeon?

79
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:55,044
That wasn't it.

80
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,589
Hello.

81
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:01,009
<i>He's a client at this law firm?</i>

82
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:03,469
Because she thinks
that if she raises her value,

83
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,763
everyone will bid on her, right?

84
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:06,681
After all,

85
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,851
that's every woman's dream, I suppose.

86
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:14,147
<i>If he hadn't smiled like that,</i>
<i>I might not have done it.</i>

87
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:28,077
<i>I mean, I did want to do it,</i>
<i>but it was purely on impulse.</i>

88
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,787
<i>Well, what's done is done.</i>

89
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:32,665
<i>A good poker face is</i>
<i>a basic requirement for a perfect crime.</i>

90
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:35,585
Aw.

91
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:41,758
What now?

92
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:43,926
Laugh.

93
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,887
-Bro, come on.
-Laugh.

94
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,263
-What?
-Just laugh.

95
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,278
Here, I got you.

96
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:04,947
There you go!

97
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,033
Well, I hope you enjoyed my show.

98
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:22,382
Damn, that was embarrassing.

99
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:24,842
Why did I overdo it
with all that laughing?

100
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:28,805
It was painfully obvious I was trying
to cover up your humiliation. Ah, damn!

101
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:29,972
Know what?

102
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,477
They tried to take me out.

103
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,520
Uh…

104
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:38,981
Okay. Let's just forget about it.

105
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:40,858
It's plausible enough.

106
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,945
Catch a man off guard, and of course
he's gonna laugh awkwardly about it.

107
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:45,238
-Dude!
-Huh?

108
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:46,864
They tripped me, I'm serious.

109
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,783
Wait, hold on. The security cameras.

110
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:49,867
Check the footage.

111
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:51,702
Then what, huh?

112
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:55,415
They get to see you fall again,
and you get to see them laugh at you?

113
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:57,458
You want to do comedy now?

114
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:58,626
Cool, cool, yeah.

115
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,462
It's over. Let's just move on, okay?

116
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:03,005
Okay. Yeah.

117
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:11,305
But who would have done that?

118
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:16,811
Hello.

119
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:21,232
I'm sure you know
Ms. Choi Soo-jin, the acclaimed actress.

120
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:23,317
She is our VIP client,

121
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,278
so she will be conducting
your interview with me.

122
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,113
-I see.
-Please sit down.

123
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:38,332
So, tell us about why
you want to join our firm.

124
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,626
Why even bother asking that?
She's here for the money.

125
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,254
Yes. Absolutely.

126
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:45,840
What was your previous area of practice?

127
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:48,926
I've worked in many areas,
both civil and criminal.

128
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,137
Have you done divorce proceedings?

129
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,263
Huh?

130
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,184
Oh, yes. Absolutely.

131
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:57,351
How'd it go?

132
00:07:57,435 --> 00:08:00,438
Winning and losing
are not so clearly defined in divorces,

133
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:02,064
but they were all partial victories.

134
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,525
-So I can say I've never been beaten.
-Mmm.

135
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:06,486
-Mm-hmm.
-Are you married?

136
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,114
-Uh, no.
-A boyfriend, then?

137
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:13,284
We actually just recently broke up. Uh…

138
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:16,204
They don't ask things like that
at job interviews these days.

139
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:19,373
Do you have a lot of experience dating?

140
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,794
Would it be bad if I said I have a lot?

141
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,838
Not at all.
It's better if you have a lot of those.

142
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,715
It means you're
well-suited to what we need.

143
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:30,468
Oh, absolutely.
I have a ton of dating experience.

144
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:32,470
To what extent? How many have you had?

145
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:35,806
I haven't kept count,
but excluding casual dates,

146
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,517
15 people?

147
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,143
Are you a player?

148
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:41,103
It's more like data collection

149
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,939
on different types of men
that are out there.

150
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,232
Oh!

151
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:46,442
Let's hear about your, uh, aspirations.

152
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,362
What kind of mindset
will you have once you're here?

153
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:52,573
Everyone says they will do
their best if they're hired, right?

154
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:56,077
Why don't you show us
some of your special talents?

155
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,119
Sorry?

156
00:08:57,203 --> 00:09:00,998
That way I can see…
just how important this is to you.

157
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:03,084
<i>I've done talent shows before,</i>

158
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:05,086
<i>but they've never gone super well.</i>

159
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:16,472
Oh my.

160
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,616
<i>Show of strength is a no-go.</i>

161
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,660
If you'd rather not, we can move on.

162
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,495
No, please. I have something.

163
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:43,708
It's called… "You'll cringe so much
that you'll want to kill me."

164
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:50,798
I do feel like killing her.

165
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,229
Ah!

166
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:35,760
-Kill her!
-Kill…

167
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:41,932
Uh, wait, are you streaming this?

168
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:42,850
Huh?

169
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,815
Thank you.

170
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,817
-Sure. Of course.
-Me too.

171
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:54,278
-Oh my gosh!
-No problem. Yeah, of course.

172
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,405
One, two, three.

173
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,240
His success rate is 100%, right?

174
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,117
-With me, one with me.
-For what?

175
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:03,788
-Sleeping with any woman he wants to.
-No way it's 100%.

176
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:06,916
Well, you're not at 10%,
so how could you imagine 100?

177
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,085
-Hey.
-One, two, three.

178
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:11,837
I got dumped
because I got caught cheating, okay?

179
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,089
We even got into the hotel

180
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,841
but then got caught
right in the hallway, man.

181
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,635
Okay. One, two, three.

182
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:20,471
-Why was your girlfriend at the hotel?
-It's not…

183
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:21,597
Oh my gosh.

184
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,099
Hey, it's not what you think.

185
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:25,601
I want a picture too!

186
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,938
So I heard you made a move on Lia
and got shot down bad.

187
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:32,358
No one knows,
but… it was the opposite.

188
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:36,946
Hey, are you kidding me?
Why on earth would Lia…

189
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:39,490
Wait, seriously?

190
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:41,742
Take a picture of us.

191
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,661
-May I hold on to you?
-Oh, sure, sure.

192
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:45,079
Thank you!

193
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:46,580
One, two, three.

194
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:51,168
One, two, three. One, two, three.

195
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:53,379
-Oh, thank you.
-Yes. Thank you.

196
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:54,964
-Thank you so much.
-Of course.

197
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,925
Oh, I ordered sushi for everyone,
if that's okay with you.

198
00:11:58,008 --> 00:11:59,885
-Oh, yes. We love it.
-Great. Enjoy your lunch.

199
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,262
-Okay, goodbye.
-Take care.

200
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:03,889
-Thank you. You too.
-Bye.

201
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:06,434
He's such a sweet guy, isn't he?

202
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:08,686
You know, good-looking guys
are often nice too.

203
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:10,438
It's the average ones
that act up, isn't it?

204
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:12,398
You're right, you're right.

205
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:14,108
Yeah, that's what I mean.

206
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:15,359
Oh my goodness.

207
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:17,153
Thank you so much.

208
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:20,364
When the employees get to meet
a big star like Mr. Nam Kang-ho,

209
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,199
they feel… proud to work here.

210
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:23,117
I bet.

211
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,911
Ah, you ladies hit the jackpot today,
didn't you?

212
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:28,664
They aren't listening.
Oh, by the way, the chairwoman…

213
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,125
I mean, Ms. Choi Soo-jin is here.

214
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,878
-Really?
-Ah. Mr. Do.

215
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:38,424
-What brings you here?
-What are you doing here?

216
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:41,844
Oh… Uh…

217
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:45,014
Remember how I said I didn't think
my lawyer understood me very well?

218
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:48,517
Well, President Yang here says
he's going to hire me a new one.

219
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,436
A female one.

220
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:54,440
You're making it seem
like I forced you to.

221
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:56,317
That's true.

222
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:58,778
Hmm.

223
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,791
Did I take it too far?

224
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,092
Hello.

225
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,187
Do you work here?

226
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,981
Uh, no. I actually just came
for an interview.

227
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:37,483
Ah.

228
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:40,110
I thought you seemed okay earlier.

229
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:43,656
I was trying to play it cool…
because I was embarrassed.

230
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,909
In fact, it hurts so much
that I may have to go see a doctor

231
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:49,370
in case there's a fracture
or a muscle tear.

232
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:51,872
-You wouldn't be walking with a fracture.
-Oh, yeah?

233
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,543
Try doing this.

234
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:03,092
Can you do this?

235
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:09,390
Uh, ow.

236
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,351
Anyway, I don't think it's fractured.

237
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:13,978
A light contusion, at worst.

238
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:16,355
By the way, um,
you didn't record it, did you?

239
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:19,108
-What?
-Me falling down earlier.

240
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:20,901
No.

241
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:24,321
Jeez.

242
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,366
What kind of person do you think I am?

243
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:29,285
Look.

244
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:41,714
Hmm.

245
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,843
Well, I hope that you feel better soon.

246
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:53,517
<i>Going down.</i>

247
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:58,856
She didn't record it,
but I know it was her.

248
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:01,692
<i>If you wanted</i>
<i>a different lawyer, you should've told me.</i>

249
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:05,112
Why would you… why would you come
all the way down here personally?

250
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:08,908
-You have to be careful about that.
-Well, I have Gil-mu's full support.

251
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,118
You're upset I came without you?

252
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:15,080
I wouldn't say upset. I just…

253
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:17,750
You can't just do things
without a discussion, okay?

254
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,126
Is that so?

255
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:22,004
No one tells me what to do,
but I'll always listen to you.

256
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:23,881
You know that.

257
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,008
Hey, Kang-ho.

258
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,301
Hi, Kang-ho.

259
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:28,969
We hardly ever see each other,

260
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:31,430
even though we're repped
by the same agency.

261
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:32,431
Hello.

262
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:34,433
Anyone interested in going for tea?

263
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:36,769
I have the rest of my day open.

264
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:38,145
-Let's go.
-Huh? Right now?

265
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:40,856
Mmm?

266
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,525
-Cheers.
-Cheers!

267
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,618
Ah!

268
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:55,996
Ah, you know what?
Spontaneous drinking is the best kind.

269
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,083
-I'll have another.
-You chugged that whole thing?

270
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,835
All right, well, have mine.

271
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:02,836
I didn't touch it.

272
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,505
Okay. Are you sure?

273
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:08,801
-I'm driving.
-Ah, right.

274
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:11,679
By the way, why do you suddenly want
a female attorney?

275
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,138
Oh…

276
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:15,891
The guys are always so busy
kissing up to me, they barely do any work.

277
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:19,603
You know women are busy flirting
and slack off on work too.

278
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:22,022
-What?
-Mmm.

279
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:25,401
So, then, I guess you don't even want
pretty girls flirting with you?

280
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:28,487
The pretty ones are the worst.
They think they can do whatever they want.

281
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:32,574
That's why you don't have a girlfriend.

282
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:35,411
Or, um, you haven't been dating at all.

283
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:36,787
Maybe you're… gay?

284
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,833
You can talk to me if you need to.
I like people like you.

285
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:44,795
They understand other genders so well,
and they usually have a lot of talent.

286
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:47,047
Oh, women always love gay guys.

287
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:50,968
Isn't it every woman's dream
to have a gay best friend, or am I wrong?

288
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:52,678
Sorry to disappoint you.

289
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:54,763
You don't have to be sorry.

290
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,933
It's not like I'm trying to become friends
with you or anything like that.

291
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:02,563
Oh, by the way,
when am I throwing the party for my award?

292
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:05,899
-Let's find a date soon.
-Tomorrow, you think? Tomorrow's good.

293
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:08,986
-What?
-Tomorrow? That's pretty short notice.

294
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:11,113
They don't call me
"Ms. Unpredictable" for nothing.

295
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,407
Anyway, I'm sure
that those who want to come

296
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:14,950
will find a way to come, as always.

297
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,119
Come on. Who would dare
turn down an invite from you?

298
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,078
There's one.

299
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:22,082
The one who makes an excuse
not to come out. Hmph.

300
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,669
He's in the same agency as me
and hasn't even shared a meal with me.

301
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:29,214
Kang Ho-dong once said that what makes
you a family is sharing a meal together.

302
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:33,343
Oh, right. Should I invite
the folks at the law firm too?

303
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:35,429
Isn't it about time
we did a company dinner?

304
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:37,598
For sure. That's a really good idea.

305
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:40,100
Wait. You know what?

306
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:43,771
I think that we should have
the two of you as cohosts.

307
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:46,607
Our staff are all busy,

308
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:49,151
and it'd be a hassle to host
two separate parties.

309
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,944
-It's perfect.
-Maybe some other time.

310
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:53,322
-Let her have hers first.
-Well, I don't like it either.

311
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:56,492
Our tastes are totally different.
I doubt you even know how to party.

312
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,160
Everyone approaches parties differently.

313
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:00,454
For me, my enjoyment isn't
the most important thing.

314
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:03,665
Right. But if I'm good,
to hell with everyone else, though, right?

315
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,501
Okay, that's enough.

316
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,670
That's good. Enough. Yeah?

317
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,216
The both of you can party as individuals.

318
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:15,135
And as soon as one
of your contracts expires,

319
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,888
please, you should find
a different agency to join.

320
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,517
I don't care which one it is.
You can both leave if you want to.

321
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,060
-Eh…
-Ooh…

322
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:25,020
-Won-jun, hey!
-Dude.

323
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,315
Oh, come on, we weren't fighting.

324
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:31,485
You know we both
tend to be direct when we talk.

325
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:33,529
We'll cohost, okay?

326
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,697
We're in the same agency, aren't we?

327
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:39,827
Oh, yeah, I could do that.

328
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,788
Mmm?

329
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:44,289
Bravo!

330
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:46,416
Mmm.

331
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:59,012
Can't I just show up right at the end?

332
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:00,556
To pay the bill?

333
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:08,522
If you don't knock it off with all that,
I'm gonna get really angry.

334
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:17,364
PRINCESS: JOHNNY'S AUTOGRAPH!

335
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:19,449
I thought Johnny was too busy to go?

336
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:23,662
He'll be there for sure. He's a good kid,
and he shows up anywhere you invite him.

337
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:26,582
Why? Did the little princess
request his autograph?

338
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:28,417
How'd you know?

339
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,793
You only make that face

340
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,879
when the little princess
send you a message.

341
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:35,382
Seriously, could you please try to be
as nice to other women as you are to her?

342
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:37,092
Even half as nice would be huge!

343
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,052
If you did that,
I wouldn't have to work so hard!

344
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:58,071
Don't you dare touch your savings.

345
00:19:58,155 --> 00:19:59,823
I told you I'd pay the rent.

346
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:01,992
I won't.

347
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:05,329
I relieve stress
by putting money into my savings.

348
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:06,246
1,818 WON SENT

349
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:10,959
And please don't cause
any more trouble, okay?

350
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,419
We can't afford to be sued.

351
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:16,340
Relax, I'm just doing this to save money
on a gym membership, I swear.

352
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:18,008
Any word on a job yet?

353
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:22,888
Is it possible
this feeling of being nagged

354
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:24,806
stems from my own insecurities?

355
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:28,977
-Do you have any more interviews or not?
-Still waiting to hear from two places.

356
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,401
Where are you going?

357
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,279
-Convenience store.
-Convenience store?

358
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:42,407
Do you know how much more expensive
that is than a supermarket?

359
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:46,495
Relax. I'm not buying anything.
It's for a part-time job.

360
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,419
Yes, hello?

361
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:58,924
Seriously? Okay, I understand.

362
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:01,426
I appreciate it.

363
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:04,596
I totally got it.

364
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:08,976
-Which one?
-Gilmu.

365
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,394
Oh.

366
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:13,563
Why? It's Lee Jin-suh, I'm guessing?

367
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:16,441
Be excited. You said yes, right?

368
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:18,986
Of course. Why wouldn't I?

369
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:23,573
-But why did they pick me?
-Oh, come on.

370
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:25,617
You're an incredible lawyer!

371
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:28,954
You win cases, you're healthy,
and you're personable.

372
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:31,999
I've never seen another lawyer
so perfect in every way.

373
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:33,709
Ah, congratulations.

374
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,877
But you were just yelling.

375
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,629
Was I? When?

376
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,715
Ah! So, what are we eating?

377
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,883
We'll go shopping.
Do you want meat or sushi?

378
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,760
-Meat!
-And red ginseng?

379
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:50,600
<i>I went up against all</i>
<i>of those guys and beat them all.</i>

380
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:55,105
<i>The one place that reached out</i>
<i>and grabbed my hand in my darkest hour.</i>

381
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:58,817
<i>As the first female attorney at Gilmu,</i>
<i>I'm going to do my best.</i>

382
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,027
<i>Let's go!</i>

383
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:04,239
In order to enter into a contract with us,
you must first sign this agreement here.

384
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,574
Okay.

385
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:12,706
<i>I will not mention to others</i>
<i>anything regarding the private affairs</i>

386
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:13,957
<i>of my clients.</i>

387
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,584
<i>If I violate the above terms,</i>

388
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:18,086
<i>not only will I be held liable</i>
<i>for civil suits,</i>

389
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,714
<i>but I will also pay</i>
<i>triple my annual salary…</i>

390
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:22,132
<i>Triple, triple!</i>

391
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:23,967
<i>…as payment for my penalties.</i>

392
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:26,428
Are we in agreement?

393
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:27,429
Oh.

394
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:28,513
Yeah.

395
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:32,017
SIGNATORY YEO MI-RAN

396
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,187
Well, you've signed the contract,
so you're one of us now.

397
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,939
Which means we can talk more freely, no?

398
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:40,025
-Yes.
-Okay.

399
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:43,862
The confidentiality agreement
is effective as of this moment,

400
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:45,530
so keep that in mind.

401
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:46,615
-Yes, sir.
-Okay.

402
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:49,576
The virtues you must possess
at this law firm are,

403
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:52,287
primarily, quick wits and understanding.

404
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:57,000
Our main clientele are celebrities,
and they are a very temperamental bunch.

405
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:58,794
Their ups and downs can be severe.

406
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:02,214
They don't even read the contents
of petition drafts. They're above that.

407
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:04,883
Just try to maintain
a friendly relationship,

408
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:07,886
take their side, give them your support,
and they'll completely trust you.

409
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:11,223
If they feel you're neglecting them,
though, the complaints begin.

410
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:12,849
Ah.

411
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:16,311
The worst of all is the lady
from your interview, Choi Soo-jin.

412
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:17,229
I see.

413
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:20,315
And from now on,
she'll be assigned to you.

414
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:25,779
Just do whatever she says,
whether it's related to the case or not.

415
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:28,073
Give her what she wants,
and everything will be fine.

416
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:30,909
-Yes, sir!
-Any questions?

417
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:31,993
Sir?

418
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,453
Questions for me?

419
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:37,040
Oh… You're President Ko Yong-woo,
aren't you?

420
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:38,667
That's right.

421
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:42,129
I'm sorry, but I thought Yang Gil-mu
was the president of this firm.

422
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:46,967
Wait, do you know someone here?

423
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:49,970
I just heard it somewhere.

424
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:54,975
Well, now that you're in our gang,
you should know who the leader is.

425
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:59,604
The man from the interview, yeah? That was
CEO Yang Gil-mu that you met with.

426
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:01,148
Ah!

427
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:03,108
On paper, he's the paralegal manager.

428
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:04,151
Ah.

429
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:06,945
-<i>A non-lawyer ownership.</i>
-Whoa, whoa, whoa. Something wrong?

430
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:09,322
Uh, no, sir.

431
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:13,869
Oh, are you done?

432
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:16,872
Uh, attention please, everyone!

433
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:18,415
Yeah, yeah.

434
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:24,004
I am pleased to announce that as of today,
our firm finally has a female attorney.

435
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:26,339
Uh, why don't you introduce yourself.

436
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:29,593
Hello, I'm Yeo Mi-ran.

437
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,471
I'm excited to…

438
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:36,349
…work with you all.

439
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:39,019
So, I would like to ask
for everyone's full support

440
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:43,857
to ensure that Ms. Yeo here
gets settled in as quickly as possible.

441
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:46,610
-Yes, sir.
-I'll give you a rundown. Over there…

442
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:47,611
How old is she?

443
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:50,989
-She's my ex-girlfriend.
-Lying through your teeth still, huh?

444
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:52,407
She was the one who left.

445
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:54,659
The hotel?

446
00:24:57,287 --> 00:25:00,540
Okay. Would someone
please take Ms. Yeo for a company tour?

447
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:04,544
-Oh, Mr. Seo--
-Sir. Allow me.

448
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:08,882
-Okay, Mr. Lee.
-All right.

449
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:10,217
Oh, one more thing.

450
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,137
We have an all-hands dinner today
with Dowon Entertainment, okay?

451
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:16,389
I already drank yesterday too.

452
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:18,725
Oh, you can drink again.
Don't make a fuss about it.

453
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:28,068
Things weren't going well at my old firm.

454
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:32,197
So I decided to leave,
which wasn't easy at all.

455
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:37,035
I know it could be awkward for you,
but don't worry. I won't cause trouble.

456
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:38,828
Things must really be bad.

457
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:41,206
You never really cared for our firm.

458
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:44,376
Hang on. I actually said that?

459
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:45,418
You didn't have to.

460
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:48,463
I could tell. I couldn't tell
you were cheating on me, though.

461
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:51,633
And this is the nap room.
There isn't a women's one.

462
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:52,634
That's okay.

463
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:57,264
Uh, you know,
because I don't plan to sleep here.

464
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:12,696
This is the company gym.

465
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,449
Unfortunately, there's
no shower for women.

466
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:17,701
Oh.

467
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:19,202
If you wanna wash up…

468
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:20,912
…I'll be your security.

469
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,789
Okay, you got it.

470
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:23,832
The cafeteria.

471
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:25,834
Drinks and snacks are all free,

472
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:28,086
and you can bring in
all the booze you want.

473
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:30,839
Ooh. How nice.

474
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:32,799
-Have a seat.
-Sure.

475
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:38,888
Aren't you busy?

476
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:41,057
I'm a salaried lawyer. I'm never busy.

477
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:45,145
We don't care if the trial
gets delayed or goes on forever.

478
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:46,980
Thanks so much.

479
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:52,193
Did you sleep together that night?

480
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:01,161
Jin-suh.

481
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:04,748
Look, I apologize for suddenly popping up
in your life again,

482
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:07,000
but let's just try to stay coworkers here.

483
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:09,336
Mr. Lee, help me out.

484
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:11,588
-Help you out, huh?
-Yes. Please.

485
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:15,550
-You're a real jerk, you know that?
-I know that.

486
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,719
That's why
I keep asking you like this.

487
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:18,637
No problem.

488
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:21,806
-I'm a chill guy, after all.
-Yeah, you are.

489
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,768
Oh, this must be
like a classic Hollywood friendship, huh?

490
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:26,519
Oh, we'll see.

491
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:29,981
Take care.

492
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:39,783
What… friendship?

493
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:42,535
Huh.

494
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:44,287
I'm sorry.

495
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:47,874
I apologize for my past actions.

496
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:51,378
I apologize for my past actions.

497
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:55,131
-I apologize for my past actions.
-What's she doing?

498
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:56,591
Is she actually being nice?

499
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:23,284
Don't close your eyes.

500
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:49,227
Cut! Okay.

501
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,312
That was great.

502
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:55,066
-Any problems?
-No problems.

503
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:57,152
He's a beast on camera
and a gentleman when it stops.

504
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:58,987
Damn, my heart is pounding.

505
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:02,824
That kiss scene was so amazing.

506
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:04,868
So you're all good with Kang-ho, right?

507
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:07,203
Some friend he is.

508
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:09,164
That wasn't a kiss
he learned from a book though.

509
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:11,875
Kang-ho doesn't have
any scandals that we know about.

510
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,921
Oh my.

511
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:25,096
Damn it.

512
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:32,187
Oh, damn.

513
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:37,567
Not even my meds work for her.

514
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:42,947
He must have an upset stomach.

515
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:45,950
-He's gay.
-What?

516
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:47,744
Do you know what would happen

517
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:50,246
if this got out?

518
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:55,418
Maybe that's how he's avoided scandals.
That would make sense, huh?

519
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:56,461
Oh.

520
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:08,473
This way!

521
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:14,646
-Hurry, hurry. Yeah, yeah.
-Seat belts! Come on!

522
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:17,190
-Get in!
-Everyone's in. We're good.

523
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:19,484
Everyone's in. We're good.

524
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,824
Ms. Yeo. Drink.

525
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:27,951
-Drink it all. Drink, drink, drink.
-Whoo!

526
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:30,620
Ah!

527
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:33,623
Wow, that perks you right up.

528
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:36,167
I haven't been able to upgrade
my repertoire. What should I do?

529
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:38,378
Oh, don't worry about your repertoire.

530
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:41,464
Listen, just back them up
when they're doing their thing.

531
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:43,424
And always remember
to cheer them on, all right?

532
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:44,926
-Yeah!
-Yes, sir!

533
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:49,097
You know, our clients
really do bear their all to us lawyers.

534
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,932
Imagine how vulnerable they feel.

535
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:54,602
Especially as celebrities, you know?
Always afraid of some kind of scandal.

536
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:58,022
Just think, how degrading would it be
if they were the only ones feeling naked

537
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:59,524
and us lawyers were always composed.

538
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:00,441
Absolutely!

539
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:03,111
That's why we embarrass ourselves
every once in a while.

540
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:05,572
-That's right.
-It builds a tight bond of camaraderie.

541
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:08,324
-Talk to 'em!
-Is that thoughtful of us, or what?

542
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:09,450
Ah, yes.

543
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:11,119
But I'm a little concerned.

544
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:15,290
Uh… you think it will be
a tad too much for this lady?

545
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:18,376
To be honest,
I'm not really that ladylike at all.

546
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:19,878
Ooh!

547
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:22,922
Ah! In that case, we're upping the ante!

548
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:25,884
Ah! Let's go,
let's go, let's go, let's go!

549
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,345
Come on, let's go. Whoo!

550
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:31,556
-Dance with me, sir.
-All right, all right!

551
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:34,392
-Yeah, yeah, let's go!
-Oh, yeah, yeah, here we go now.

552
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:38,146
-Hey, look at her, look at her.
-Oh, you've got moves.

553
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:41,190
<i>You guys can't hold</i>
<i>a candle to me in anything.</i>

554
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:45,194
Yeah, you know it!

555
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:48,948
Let's go!

556
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:51,701
<i>Do I really have to win?</i>

557
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:53,620
Yeah!

558
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:04,339
Right! So I was like…

559
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:06,799
I'm glad I fired you!

560
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,859
-Yeah!
-Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey!

561
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,612
Wait. Hey, have you met
Mr. Do Won-jun yet?

562
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:29,656
She's the first female attorney
Gilmu's ever hired.

563
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:31,574
Now Ms. Choi Soo-jin's her client.

564
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:35,662
That's right. I'm Yeo Mi-ran.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

565
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:37,121
It's a pleasure meeting you too.

566
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:39,582
-Look, I know you'll take good care of…
-Mmm.

567
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:48,466
…our dear Ms. Soo-jin.

568
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:50,176
Of course. I'll do my best.

569
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:51,386
Yes?

570
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:53,054
-I'm going to the men's room.
-Oh, yes!

571
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:08,194
Hey!

572
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,201
And that's for you!

573
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:19,914
-I saw your pink undies!
-Hey, what are you doing?

574
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:23,376
Talk to my agent. He'll get you a pair
of my pants. There's some in the van.

575
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:25,044
Great job!

576
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:27,338
Go, go, go!
Don't turn around. Just go.

577
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:29,298
Great! That's good.

578
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:32,468
All right, everyone.

579
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:34,053
Are we having a good time?

580
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:35,346
Yeah!

581
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,432
Just so you know, we are lawyers.

582
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:40,768
All right, let's keep that energy going,
because next up

583
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,228
is our newcomer initiation!

584
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:44,939
Why don't we all give her a hand?

585
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:47,316
Do what you did yesterday.
Do what you did yesterday.

586
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,278
-So good!
-Go, Ms. Yeo! Go, Ms. Yeo! Go…

587
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:52,196
I really did want to strangle her.

588
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,824
You know
the whole routine, don't you?

589
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:56,909
Of course you do.
You're a brilliant actress.

590
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:58,619
Yeah!

591
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:00,038
You can do it!

592
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:02,248
-You can do it!
-Oh!

593
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:04,250
-Yeah!
-<i>Preemptive dominance.</i>

594
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:06,836
<i>I have to take charge</i>
<i>before they think I'm weak.</i>

595
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,715
What are you doing?

596
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:14,802
-Calming yourself down because I was late?
-No.

597
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:18,306
What a relief.
As long as it wasn't me, right?

598
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:24,645
Someone in there
has seen you fall down, man.

599
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:28,066
That time you fell down
like a complete idiot.

600
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:29,692
So, then why are you out here?

601
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:31,110
I'm embarrassed.

602
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:33,404
I'm the one who fell down,
so why do you care?

603
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:35,823
Seriously, why did I overdo it
with the laughing?

604
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:40,328
Ah.

605
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:41,871
It was pretty awkward.

606
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:44,040
I'd be super embarrassed too.

607
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:47,210
Good for you, though.
Quitting acting was the right choice.

608
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:50,713
-Shut up and get inside.
-Yeah.

609
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:57,637
One of the worst things
a human being can go through

610
00:34:58,429 --> 00:34:59,806
is the pain of embarrassment.

611
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:07,230
What are you gonna do?

612
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:08,523
What are you going to do?

613
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:29,794
Ooh!

614
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:49,063
-<i>Don't panic.</i>
-Whoo! You can do it!

615
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:51,190
<i>Don't panic. Don't panic.</i>

616
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:55,194
<i>If I panic now,</i>
<i>I'll never live it down.</i>

617
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,843
Thank you. Thank you.

618
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,681
That was fantastic. Wow.

619
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:25,683
Mr. Nam Kang-ho, how are you?

620
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:28,728
<i>What in the world</i>
<i>is this bizarre specimen?</i>

621
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:31,689
<i>Damn it.</i>
<i>I shouldn't have tripped him.</i>

622
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,817
Here. Here, sit here.

623
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:36,777
You're good.

624
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:38,070
-Oh, hey.
-Oh, hello.

625
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:40,072
-Yeah.
-It's been a while.

626
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,605
Go, girl!

627
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:20,780
<i>I totally get</i>
<i>the absurd camaraderie</i>

628
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:22,573
<i>men can have in their work lives.</i>

629
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:24,659
<i>I'm just disgusted by it.</i>

630
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,455
Wow, she really loves to sing, man.

631
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:32,750
I wonder why it never gets any better.

632
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:35,753
-Yo, yo, yo. That's her?
Yeah. You remember her, right?

633
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:37,838
Oh, yeah. Absolutely.

634
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:40,591
Very good! Yeah!

635
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:42,927
-Johnny!
-Johnny?

636
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:45,596
You have a singer's name,
so get up here and sing!

637
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,516
Come on up, Johnny!

638
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,184
-Johnny.
-You can do it!

639
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:51,769
Let's have a drink.

640
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:56,857
Yeah, yeah, Johnny, Johnny. Hey, look.
Kang-ho really wants your autograph, man.

641
00:37:56,941 --> 00:38:00,069
He's been talking about it for days.
Get it before you forget.

642
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:02,321
And maybe do it outside.
Inside's a bit nuts.

643
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:05,574
-Be sure to write something good.
-Yes, sir. I understand.

644
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:07,159
He has a shoot on Jeju in the morning.

645
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:09,161
Send him straight home
when you get outside.

646
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:10,329
Okay.

647
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:17,461
Yeo Mi-ran!
Yeo Mi-ran! Yeo Mi-ran!

648
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:19,088
Yeo Mi-ran!

649
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:45,948
Yeah, see?

650
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:49,118
Did I pick the right person,
or what?

651
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:53,122
All right, everyone raise your glass.
Okay, cheers!

652
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:55,624
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

653
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:06,761
No!

654
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,554
Are you drunk?

655
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:12,600
Come on.

656
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:15,227
I'll see you later, Mr. Nam.

657
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:16,312
Yeah, you take care.

658
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:19,315
-Have a good one.
-Sure thing!

659
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:25,654
Baby, you are so cool.

660
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:31,952
-Be quiet!
-Huh? Huh?

661
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:35,581
There's no one here but us.

662
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:37,833
Mmm.

663
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:47,593
Oh, take it easy.

664
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:50,304
Sexually harassing a coworker.

665
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:51,222
What?

666
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:54,558
However, I'll let it slide
under one condition.

667
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:57,770
You and I are
strictly coworkers from now on, okay?

668
00:39:57,853 --> 00:39:59,146
Huh, what?

669
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:04,902
Go wash your face.

670
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:10,616
-Ooh!
-Ah!

671
00:40:13,702 --> 00:40:16,288
It's dirty here. Get up. Hey, get up.

672
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:17,498
Ah, jeez.

673
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:18,749
Hey.

674
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:20,000
Hey, hey, hey. Wake up.

675
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:22,461
-Wash your face.
-I won't wash my face, damn it.

676
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:24,380
I'm not washing my face.

677
00:40:24,463 --> 00:40:26,382
Uh, what are you doing?

678
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:28,092
Uh…

679
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:31,512
-You just see if I wash my face.
-Hey, Mr. Lee.

680
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:34,181
Are you upset
because of your torn pants, huh? Huh?

681
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:37,518
That's why you shouldn't have lost
at rock, paper, scissors. Oh!

682
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:39,812
Jeez.

683
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:41,814
Ah, well,

684
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:44,275
so you embarrassed yourself
in front of your ex.

685
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:48,279
But you really livened up the mood.
I laughed so hard I split a seam.

686
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:50,739
Guess your pants…
…did too.

687
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:52,950
Did you even open
your fly before you peed?

688
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:54,827
Yeah.

689
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:55,995
Ugh, this guy.

690
00:40:57,371 --> 00:40:59,290
Hey. By the way,

691
00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:01,667
did things really end between you?

692
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:03,377
You…

693
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:04,879
What?

694
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,674
You look terrible.

695
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:15,556
Here, here, here. Where do you live?

696
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:17,224
I'll give you a ride.

697
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:18,142
Let's go!

698
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:19,560
I live pretty far.

699
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:20,978
Go home and rest, okay?

700
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:24,148
Hey, Yeo Mi-ran, I'm the one
who got this job for you.

701
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:28,903
I asked them to give me a female lawyer,
and that's why they hired you.

702
00:41:29,945 --> 00:41:33,073
So do you think you should be
a good girl to me or not?

703
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:35,618
<i>I was hired because I'm a woman?</i>

704
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:37,495
So, now tell me where you stay.

705
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:41,415
-I need to go to the restroom.
-Oh, the restroom? The rest…

706
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:43,083
-You should go. Hurry up.
-Okay.

707
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:51,133
Whoa, whoa. Are you okay?

708
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:53,052
Not in the slightest.

709
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:54,595
But you know that.

710
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:58,265
I act like I'm having fun,
but I'm really not.

711
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:02,478
Aw, what's wrong, darling?

712
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:04,813
Huh? So you had a good time for a change.

713
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:07,650
-Mmm.
-Come on. Let's go, let's go.

714
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:11,487
-I can drive you home myself tonight.
-You will?

715
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:13,405
You really want to do that?

716
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:15,491
Do you feel like taking my car or yours?

717
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:18,827
Whichever one's closer.

718
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:26,418
<i>I was so happy</i>
<i>that I had bested all those guys.</i>

719
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:29,046
<i>So this is what</i>
<i>reverse discrimination feels like.</i>

720
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:35,636
Oh!

721
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:37,888
I'm sorry.

722
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:39,473
No need to apologize.

723
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:43,978
You weren't… waiting for me, were you?

724
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:45,104
What?

725
00:42:47,856 --> 00:42:49,525
Oh, no. Why would I wait for you?

726
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:52,069
Well, it would definitely make
a lot of sense.

727
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:54,655
You know, because of
your… performance before.

728
00:43:02,037 --> 00:43:04,498
Oh, look, that was just--

729
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:07,042
I think you have a knack
for getting men's attention, don't you?

730
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:10,754
-Huh?
-You even landed my attention.

731
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:13,591
It was you at the office, wasn't it?

732
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:20,055
I felt when your foot touched mine.

733
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:22,057
You must have felt
when my foot touched yours, no?

734
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:25,269
<i>This man is a VIP client.</i>

735
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:27,438
<i>What do I do? Deny it to the bitter end?</i>

736
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:30,399
If you deny it
to the bitter end…

737
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:32,359
Okay, I'm sorry.

738
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:38,240
The truth is, I stretched out my leg
at the wrong time that day.

739
00:43:38,824 --> 00:43:40,451
I'm really sorry.

740
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:45,581
Lying to me won't help you out here.

741
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:49,835
But because you recognize
that I'm not a fool,

742
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:52,504
that means you aren't one either.

743
00:43:53,505 --> 00:43:56,425
So, since you mentioned it…

744
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:00,763
did you really stretch at the wrong time?

745
00:44:00,846 --> 00:44:02,973
-It wasn't intentional?
-What?

746
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:07,561
There are women who do anything it takes
to make sure you don't ever forget them.

747
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:09,229
It's true.

748
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:12,483
I see their faces, ask their names,
take pictures, and sign autographs.

749
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:15,027
And really, to be honest,
there are so many

750
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:16,362
that I can't remember every one.

751
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:20,157
But the ones who decide to hurt me
without a care in the world,

752
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,035
those are the ones
that I just cannot let go.

753
00:44:23,118 --> 00:44:24,912
They really are pathetic.

754
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:29,708
Oh, I'm not like that. I was stretching
my leg, and it just happened to--

755
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:32,336
If that was the case,
you should have said you were sorry.

756
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:34,797
I'm attacking an innocent person?

757
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,799
Is that the point
you're really trying to make?

758
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:39,718
I would've dropped it
if you just apologized,

759
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:41,762
but if you really did nothing wrong,
then prove it.

760
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:43,847
Let's go check Gilmu's security footage.

761
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:47,184
That way we'll know once and for all
if it really was an accident.

762
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:49,269
Um, wait.

763
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:55,317
I'm really sorry.

764
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:56,694
I did it, okay?

765
00:44:57,903 --> 00:44:59,780
Because I'm such a huge fan of yours!

766
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:09,915
It's just… I really like you.

767
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:15,212
I… I just wanted
to touch you once, that's all.

768
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:18,215
I'm so sorry.

769
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:20,801
Come on.

770
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:38,318
Here's a tip,
be more careful with your love.

771
00:45:39,194 --> 00:45:41,029
You hear me? Okay?

772
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:43,824
Yes.

773
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:46,076
I will, I promise.

774
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:01,300
<i>I'm not the first person</i>
<i>to throw away their dignity</i>

775
00:46:01,383 --> 00:46:03,051
<i>just to put food on the table.</i>

776
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:06,472
<i>I've never confessed</i>
<i>my love to a man before,</i>

777
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:08,849
<i>so whatever happens… happens.</i>

778
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:22,196
Where did everyone go?

779
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:49,848
I just know her type.

780
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:53,185
She pretends to be easygoing
and gets men to drop their guard.

781
00:46:53,268 --> 00:46:55,103
Then she seduces and uses them.

782
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:00,442
-She says she's a fan of mine.
-Hmm?

783
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:02,945
But I think it'd be best
if she stays away from me.

784
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:03,862
Mmm.

785
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:08,116
Different woman, same problems, huh?

786
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:11,203
-Yeah.
-What about Ji-woo?

787
00:47:11,286 --> 00:47:13,705
-You get along fine with her.
-I don't know anymore.

788
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:15,374
I can't stand these girls.

789
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:22,798
Hmm?

790
00:47:22,881 --> 00:47:24,758
Dude, isn't that Ji-woo?

791
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:35,602
-Ji-woo.
-Hi.

792
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:39,398
-What are you doing out here?
-I was just, um… waiting for you.

793
00:47:39,898 --> 00:47:42,067
It's been a while.
You look great.

794
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:45,195
Yo, you forgot this.

795
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:47,447
Are you hungry?

796
00:47:49,157 --> 00:47:50,742
Why are you dressed so light?

797
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:54,288
Come here, let me give you a hug.
You must be freezing.

798
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:57,416
Let's go inside.

799
00:47:58,542 --> 00:47:59,376
Okay.

800
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:05,215
See you around. Good night.

801
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:20,022
Have I been cursed somehow?

802
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:27,195
<i>I can't stand these girls.</i>

803
00:48:31,533 --> 00:48:32,659
Yes!

804
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:34,536
Uh-oh. Oh!

805
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:44,338
Yes! At least they're outside now.

806
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:55,974
What's this?

807
00:48:58,226 --> 00:48:59,728
Here. Have a good night.

808
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:05,567
Guys really are the worst.

809
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:20,374
POLICE

810
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:27,172
Seriously? Is he actually
the president in disguise?
