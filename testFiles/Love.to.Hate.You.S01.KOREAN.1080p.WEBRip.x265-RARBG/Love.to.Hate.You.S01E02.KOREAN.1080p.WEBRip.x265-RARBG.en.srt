00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:52,576
Ah! [chuckles]

345
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,955
Ah, you know what?
Spontaneous drinking is the best kind.

346
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:59,041
-I'll have another. [chuckles]
-You chugged that whole thing?

347
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,794
-[Soo-jin sighs]
-All right, well, have mine.

348
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:02,795
I didn't touch it.

349
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:04,463
Okay. Are you sure?

350
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:08,759
-I'm driving.
-Ah, right.

351
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:11,637
By the way, why do you suddenly want
a female attorney?

352
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,097
Oh… [sighs]

353
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,849
The guys are always so busy
kissing up to me, they barely do any work.

354
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:19,561
[scoffs] You know women are busy flirting
and slack off on work too.

355
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:21,981
-What?
-Mmm.

356
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:25,359
So, then, I guess you don't even want
pretty girls flirting with you?

357
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:28,445
The pretty ones are the worst.
They think they can do whatever they want.

358
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,197
[Soo-jin gasps, laughs]

359
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,533
That's why you don't have a girlfriend.

360
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:35,369
Or, um, you haven't been dating at all.

361
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:36,745
Maybe you're… gay?

362
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:37,705
[scoffs]

363
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:40,791
You can talk to me if you need to.
I like people like you.

364
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:44,753
They understand other genders so well,
and they usually have a lot of talent.

365
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,006
Oh, women always love gay guys.

366
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:47,923
[chuckles]

367
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,926
Isn't it every woman's dream
to have a gay best friend, or am I wrong?

368
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,636
Sorry to disappoint you.

369
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,722
[Soo-jin] You don't have to be sorry.

370
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:57,891
It's not like I'm trying to become friends
with you or anything like that.

371
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:02,521
Oh, by the way,
when am I throwing the party for my award?

372
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:05,858
-Let's find a date soon.
-Tomorrow, you think? Tomorrow's good.

373
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:08,944
-What?
-Tomorrow? That's pretty short notice.

374
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,071
They don't call me
"Ms. Unpredictable" for nothing.

375
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:13,365
Anyway, I'm sure
that those who want to come

376
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:14,908
will find a way to come, as always.

377
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:17,077
Come on. Who would dare
turn down an invite from you?

378
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,037
There's one.

379
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:22,041
The one who makes an excuse
not to come out. Hmph.

380
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,627
He's in the same agency as me
and hasn't even shared a meal with me.

381
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:29,173
Kang Ho-dong once said that what makes
you a family is sharing a meal together.

382
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:33,302
Oh, right. Should I invite
the folks at the law firm too?

383
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,387
Isn't it about time
we did a company dinner?

384
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,556
For sure. That's a really good idea.

385
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,059
Wait. You know what?

386
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:43,729
I think that we should have
the two of you as cohosts.

387
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:44,688
[baby toy squeaks]

388
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,565
Our staff are all busy,

389
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:49,109
and it'd be a hassle to host
two separate parties.

390
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,903
-It's perfect.
-Maybe some other time.

391
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:53,280
-Let her have hers first.
-Well, I don't like it either.

392
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:56,450
Our tastes are totally different.
I doubt you even know how to party.

393
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,118
Everyone approaches parties differently.

394
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,412
For me, my enjoyment isn't
the most important thing.

395
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:03,624
Right. But if I'm good,
to hell with everyone else, though, right?

396
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:05,459
-[whistle blows]
-Okay, that's enough.

397
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,629
That's good. Enough. Yeah?

398
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,174
The both of you can party as individuals.

399
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:15,094
And as soon as one
of your contracts expires,

400
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,846
please, you should find
a different agency to join.

401
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:21,475
I don't care which one it is.
You can both leave if you want to.

402
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:23,018
-Eh…
-Ooh…

403
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,978
-Won-jun, hey!
-Dude.

404
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,105
[Won-jun sighs]

405
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,273
Oh, come on, we weren't fighting.

406
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:31,443
[chuckles] You know we both
tend to be direct when we talk.

407
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,487
We'll cohost, okay?

408
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,656
We're in the same agency, aren't we?

409
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:39,785
[awkwardly] Oh, yeah, I could do that.

410
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,746
-[Won-jun inhales sharply]
-Mmm?

411
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:44,248
Bravo!

412
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:45,207
[both laughing]

413
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,375
Mmm.

414
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,547
-[chuckles]
-[chiming]

415
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,971
Can't I just show up right at the end?

416
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:00,514
To pay the bill?

417
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:04,226
[sighs]

418
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:08,480
If you don't knock it off with all that,
I'm gonna get really angry.

419
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,567
-[Kang-ho sighs]
-[phone vibrates]

420
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,322
PRINCESS: JOHNNY'S AUTOGRAPH!

421
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,408
I thought Johnny was too busy to go?

422
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:23,620
He'll be there for sure. He's a good kid,
and he shows up anywhere you invite him.

423
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:26,540
Why? Did the little princess
request his autograph?

424
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:28,375
How'd you know?

425
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:29,751
You only make that face

426
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,837
when the little princess
send you a message.

427
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,340
Seriously, could you please try to be
as nice to other women as you are to her?

428
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,050
Even half as nice would be huge!

429
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:39,011
If you did that,
I wouldn't have to work so hard!

430
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:40,929
[pensive music playing]

431

437
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:58,030
Don't you dare touch your savings.

438
00:19:58,113 --> 00:19:59,781
I told you I'd pay the rent.

439
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:01,950
I won't.

440
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:05,287
I relieve stress
by putting money into my savings.

441
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,205
1,818 WON SENT

442
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:10,918
And please don't cause
any more trouble, okay?

443
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:12,377
We can't afford to be sued.

444
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:16,298
Relax, I'm just doing this to save money
on a gym membership, I swear.

445
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:17,966
Any word on a job yet?

446
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:19,760
[exhales deeply]

447
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:22,846
Is it possible
this feeling of being nagged

448
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,765
stems from my own insecurities?

449
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:28,936
-Do you have any more interviews or not?
-Still waiting to hear from two places.

450
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:30,729
[sighs]

451
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:36,360
Where are you going?

452
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,238
-Convenience store.
-Convenience store?

453
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:42,366
Do you know how much more expensive
that is than a supermarket?

454
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:46,453
Relax. I'm not buying anything.
It's for a part-time job.

455
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:47,371
[exhales]

457
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,378
Yes, hello?

458
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,882
Seriously? Okay, I understand.

459
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:01,385
I appreciate it.

460
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:02,594
[phone beeps off]

461
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,554
I totally got it.

[squealing excitedly, laughing]

463
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:08,934
-Which one?
-Gilmu.

-Oh.
-[gong rings]

465
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:13,522
Why? It's Lee Jin-suh, I'm guessing?

466
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:16,400
[sighs] Be excited. You said yes, right?

467
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,944
Of course. Why wouldn't I?

468
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:23,532
-But why did they pick me?
-[sighs] Oh, come on.

469
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:25,575
You're an incredible lawyer!

470
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:28,912
You win cases, you're healthy,
and you're personable. [exclaims]

471
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:31,957
I've never seen another lawyer
so perfect in every way.

472
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,667
Ah, congratulations.

473
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,836
[scoffs] But you were just yelling.

474
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,587
Was I? When?

475
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:39,673
Ah! So, what are we eating?

476
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:41,842
We'll go shopping.
Do you want meat or sushi?

477
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:43,719
-Meat!
-And red ginseng?

478
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,637

-<i>Let's go!</i>

484

In order to enter into a contract with us,
you must first sign this agreement here.

485
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:05,532
Okay.

486
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:12,664
[Gil-mu]<i> I will not mention to others</i>

SIGNATORY YEO MI-RAN

497
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:35,145
Well, you've signed the contract,
so you're one of us now.

498
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:37,898
Which means we can talk more freely, no?

499
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:39,983
-Yes.
-Okay.

500
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:43,820
[inhales] The confidentiality agreement

-Yes, sir.
-Okay.

503
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:49,534
The virtues you must possess
at this law firm are,

504
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:52,245
primarily, quick wits and understanding.

505
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:56,958
Our main clientele are celebrities,
and they are a very temperamental bunch.

506
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,752
Their ups and downs can be severe.

507
00:22:58,835 --> 00:23:02,172
They don't even read the contents
of petition drafts. They're above that.

508
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:04,841
Just try to maintain
a friendly relationship,

509
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:07,844
take their side, give them your support,
and they'll completely trust you.

510
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:11,181
If they feel you're neglecting them,
though, the complaints begin.

511
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:12,808
Ah.

512
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:16,269
The worst of all is the lady
from your interview, Choi Soo-jin.

513
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:17,187
I see.

514
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:20,273
And from now on,
she'll be assigned to you.

515
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:21,274
[gasps]

516
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:25,737
[clicks tongue] Just do whatever she says,
whether it's related to the case or not.

517
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:28,031
Give her what she wants,
and everything will be fine.

518
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:30,867
-Yes, sir!
-[man] Any questions?

519
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:31,952
Sir?

520
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:33,412
Questions for me?

521
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:36,998
Oh… You're President Ko Yong-woo,
aren't you?

522
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:38,625
[chuckles] That's right.

523
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:42,087
I'm sorry, but I thought Yang Gil-mu
was the president of this firm.

524
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:46,925
Wait, do you know someone here?

525
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:49,928
[laughs nervously]
I just heard it somewhere.

526
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:54,933
Well, now that you're in our gang,
you should know who the leader is.

527
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:59,563
The man from the interview, yeah? That was
CEO Yang Gil-mu that you met with.

528
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:01,106
Ah!

529
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:03,066
On paper, he's the paralegal manager.

530
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,109
Ah.

531
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:06,903
-[Mi-ran] <i>A non-lawyer ownership.</i>
-Whoa, whoa, whoa. Something wrong?

532
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,281
Uh, no, sir.

533
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:10,782
-[door opens]
-[Gil-mu chuckles]

534
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:13,827
Oh, are you done?

535
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:16,830
Uh, attention please, everyone!

536
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:18,373
Yeah, yeah.

537
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:23,962
I am pleased to announce that as of today,
our firm finally has a female attorney.

538
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:26,298
Uh, why don't you introduce yourself.

539
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,551
Hello, I'm Yeo Mi-ran.

540
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:31,344
[all applauding, cheering]

541
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:32,429
I'm excited to…

542
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:36,308
-[comical note plays]
-…work with you all.

543
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:38,977
So, I would like to ask
for everyone's full support

544
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:43,815
to ensure that Ms. Yeo here
gets settled in as quickly as possible.

545
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:46,568
-[all] Yes, sir.
-I'll give you a rundown. Over there…

546
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:47,569
How old is she?

547
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:50,947
-She's my ex-girlfriend.
-Lying through your teeth still, huh?

548
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:52,365
She was the one who left.

549
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,618
The hotel?

550
00:24:57,245 --> 00:25:00,499
Okay. Would someone
please take Ms. Yeo for a company tour?

551
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:01,708
[clears throat]

552
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:04,503
-Oh, Mr. Seo--
-Sir. Allow me.

553
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:05,420
[gulps]

554
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:08,840
-Okay, Mr. Lee.
-[Gil-mu chuckles] All right.

555
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:10,175
Oh, one more thing.

556
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:14,095
We have an all-hands dinner today
with Dowon Entertainment, okay?

557
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,348
-[men laugh]
-I already drank yesterday too.

558
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:18,683
Oh, you can drink again.
Don't make a fuss about it.

559
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:28,026
Things weren't going well at my old firm.

560
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:32,155
So I decided to leave,
which wasn't easy at all.

561
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:36,993
I know it could be awkward for you,
but don't worry. I won't cause trouble.

562
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:38,787
Things must really be bad.

563
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:41,164
You never really cared for our firm.

564
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:44,334
Hang on. I actually said that?

565
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:45,377
You didn't have to.

566
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,421
I could tell. I couldn't tell
you were cheating on me, though.

567
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:51,591
And this is the nap room.
There isn't a women's one.

568
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:52,592
That's okay.

569
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:57,222
Uh, you know,
because I don't plan to sleep here.

570
00:25:58,181 --> 00:26:01,935
[intriguing music playing]

571
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:07,983
[squealing excitedly]

572
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:12,654
This is the company gym.

573
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:16,408
Unfortunately, there's
no shower for women.

574
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:17,659
Oh.

575
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:19,160
If you wanna wash up…

576
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:20,870
-[gun cocks]
-…I'll be your security.

577
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:22,747
Okay, you got it.

578
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:23,790
The cafeteria.

579
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:25,792
Drinks and snacks are all free,

580
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:28,044
and you can bring in
all the booze you want.

581
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,797
Ooh. How nice.

582
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:32,757
-Have a seat.
-Sure.

583
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:36,177
[inhales deeply]

584
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,721
[intriguing music continues]

585
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:38,847
Aren't you busy?

586
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,016
I'm a salaried lawyer. I'm never busy.

587
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:45,103
We don't care if the trial
gets delayed or goes on forever.

588
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:46,938
Thanks so much.

589
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:52,152
-Did you sleep together that night?
-[coughing]

590
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:54,362
[inhales deeply]

591
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:01,119
[inhales deeply] Jin-suh.

592
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:04,706
Look, I apologize for suddenly popping up
in your life again,

593
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:06,958
but let's just try to stay coworkers here.

594
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:09,294
Mr. Lee, help me out.

595
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:11,546
-Help you out, huh?
-Yes. Please.

596
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:15,508
-You're a real jerk, you know that?
-[sighs] I know that.

597
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:17,677
[in soft voice] That's why
I keep asking you like this.

598
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:18,595
No problem.

599
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:21,765
-I'm a chill guy, after all.
-Yeah, you are.

600
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:24,726
Oh, this must be
like a classic Hollywood friendship, huh?

601
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:26,478
Oh, we'll see.

602
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:28,688
[chuckling]

603
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:29,939
Take care.

604
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:32,067
[intriguing music continues]

605
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:32,984
[chimes]

606
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:39,741
What… friendship?

607
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,494
Huh.

608
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:44,245
I'm sorry.

609
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:47,832
I apologize for my past actions.

610
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:51,336
I apologize for my past actions.

611
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:55,090
-I apologize for my past actions.
-What's she doing?

612
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:56,549
Is she actually being nice?

613
00:27:57,133 --> 00:28:00,512
[romantic music playing]

614
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:02,430
[breathing heavily]

615
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:23,243
Don't close your eyes.

-[romantic music continues]

617
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:49,185
-Cut! Okay.
-[assistant director gasps]

618
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,271
-[director] That was great.
-[applauding]

619
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:52,647
[sighs]

620
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:55,024
-[director] Any problems?
-[assistant director] No problems.

621
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:57,110
He's a beast on camera
and a gentleman when it stops.

622
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:58,945
[woman] Damn, my heart is pounding.

623
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:00,697
[women laughing]

624
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,782
That kiss scene was so amazing.

625
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:04,826
So you're all good with Kang-ho, right?

626
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:07,162
[scoffs] Some friend he is.

627
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:09,122
That wasn't a kiss
he learned from a book though.

628
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:11,833
Kang-ho doesn't have
any scandals that we know about.

629

631
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:16,880
Oh my.

632
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,965
[continues gagging]

633
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:20,300

[coughing]

636
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:25,054
Damn it.

637
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:26,639
[Kang-ho continues coughing]

638
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,266
[groans]

639
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:32,145
Oh, damn.

640
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:35,023
[breathing heavily]

641
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:37,525
Not even my meds work for her.

642
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:42,906
He must have an upset stomach.

643
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:44,324
[laughs incredulously]

644
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:45,909
-He's gay.
-What?

645
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:47,702
Do you know what would happen

646
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:50,205
if this got out?

647
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:55,376
Maybe that's how he's avoided scandals.
That would make sense, huh?

648
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,419
Oh.

649
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,547
[ominous music continues]

650
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,466
[shouting indistinctly]

651
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:05,595
[all shouting excitedly]

-[all cheer]
-This way!

654
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,850
[indistinct chattering]

655

-[man 1] Hurry, hurry. Yeah, yeah.
-[man 2] Seat belts! Come on!

656
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:17,148
-[man 3] Get in!
-Everyone's in. We're good.

657
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:19,442
Everyone's in. We're good.

658
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:22,153
[upbeat music continues]

659
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:23,905
[men cheering]

660
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:25,782
Ms. Yeo. Drink.

661
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:27,909
-Drink it all. Drink, drink, drink.
-Whoo!

662
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:30,578
Ah!

663
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:33,581
Wow, that perks you right up.

664
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:36,125
I haven't been able to upgrade
my repertoire. What should I do?

665
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:38,336
Oh, don't worry about your repertoire.

666
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:41,422
Listen, just back them up
when they're doing their thing.

667
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,383
And always remember
to cheer them on, all right?

668
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:44,884
-Yeah!
-Yes, sir!

669
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:49,055
You know, our clients
really do bear their all to us lawyers.

670
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:50,890
Imagine how vulnerable they feel.

671
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:54,561
Especially as celebrities, you know?
Always afraid of some kind of scandal.

672
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:57,981
Just think, how degrading would it be
if they were the only ones feeling naked

673
00:30:58,064 --> 00:30:59,482
and us lawyers were always composed.

674
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:00,400
Absolutely!

675
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:03,069
That's why we embarrass ourselves
every once in a while.

676
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:05,530
-That's right.
-It builds a tight bond of camaraderie.

677
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:08,283
-Talk to 'em!
-Is that thoughtful of us, or what?

678
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:09,409
Ah, yes. [chuckles]

679
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:11,077
But I'm a little concerned.

680
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:15,248
Uh… you think it will be
a tad too much for this lady?

681
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:18,334
[chuckles] To be honest,
I'm not really that ladylike at all.

682
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:19,836
Ooh! [laughing]

Yeah, see?

850
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:49,076
Did I pick the right person,
or what? [laughing]

851
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:53,080
All right, everyone raise your glass.
Okay, cheers!

No!

856
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:08,512
Are you drunk?

857

-[groans]
-Come on.

858
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,186
I'll see you later, Mr. Nam.

859
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:16,270
Yeah, you take care.

860
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:19,273
-Have a good one.
-Sure thing!

861
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,613
Baby, you are so cool.

Oh, take it easy. [groans]

871

Sexually harassing a coworker.

872
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:51,180
What?

873
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,517
However, I'll let it slide
under one condition.

874
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:57,728
You and I are
strictly coworkers from now on, okay?

875
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:59,105

Hey.

Hey, hey, hey. Wake up.

887
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:22,420
-Wash your face.
-I won't wash my face, damn it.

888
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:24,338
I'm not washing my face.

889
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:26,340
Uh, what are you doing?

890
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:28,050
-Uh…
-[scoffs]

891
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:31,470
-[Jin-suh] You just see if I wash my face.
-Hey, Mr. Lee.

892
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:34,140
Are you upset
because of your torn pants, huh? Huh?

893
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:37,476
That's why you shouldn't have lost
at rock, paper, scissors. Oh!

894
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,436
[chuckles]

895
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:39,770
Jeez.

896
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:41,772
Ah, well,

897
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:44,233
so you embarrassed yourself
in front of your ex.

898
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:48,237
But you really livened up the mood.
I laughed so hard I split a seam.

899
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,698
Guess your pants…
[popping] …did too. [chuckles]

900
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:52,908
Did you even open
your fly before you peed?

901
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,785
Yeah. [groans]

902
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:55,953
Ugh, this guy.

903
00:40:57,329 --> 00:40:59,248
Hey. By the way,

904
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:01,625
did things really end between you?

905
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:03,335
You…

906
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:04,837
What?

907
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:08,632
-[groans]
-[Young-ki] You look terrible.

[all chattering indistinctly]

909
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:15,514
Here, here, here. Where do you live?

910
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:17,183
I'll give you a ride.

911
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:18,100
Let's go!

912
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:19,518
I live pretty far.

913
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:20,936
Go home and rest, okay?

914
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:24,106
Hey, Yeo Mi-ran, I'm the one
who got this job for you.

915
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:28,861
I asked them to give me a female lawyer,
and that's why they hired you.

916
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:29,820
[gasps]

917
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:33,032
So do you think you should be
a good girl to me or not?

918
00:41:33,115 --> 00:41:35,576
[Mi-ran] <i>I was hired because I'm a woman?</i>

919
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:37,453
So, now tell me where you stay.

920
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:41,373
-I need to go to the restroom.
-Oh, the restroom? The rest…

921
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:43,042
-You should go. Hurry up.
-Okay.

922
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:45,669
[intriguing music playing]

923
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:51,091
Whoa, whoa. Are you okay?

924
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:53,010
Not in the slightest.

925
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:54,553
But you know that.

926
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:58,224
[tearfully] I act like I'm having fun,
but I'm really not.

927
00:41:58,307 --> 00:41:59,433
[chuckles]

928
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:02,436
Aw, what's wrong, darling?

929
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,772
Huh? So you had a good time for a change.

930
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:07,608
-Mmm.
-Come on. Let's go, let's go.

931
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:11,445
-I can drive you home myself tonight.
-You will?

932
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:13,364
You really want to do that?

933
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:15,449
Do you feel like taking my car or yours?

934
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:18,786
[groans] Whichever one's closer.

935

Oh!

943
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:37,846
I'm sorry.

944
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:39,431
No need to apologize.

947
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:45,062
What?

[laughs incredulously]

949
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:49,483
Oh, no. Why would I wait for you?

950
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:52,027
Well, it would definitely make
a lot of sense.

951
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:54,613

your… performance before.

[laughs] Oh, look, that was just--

956
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:07,001
I think you have a knack
for getting men's attention, don't you?

957
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:10,713
-Huh?
-You even landed my attention.

958
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:13,549
It was you at the office, wasn't it?

959
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:14,842
[gasps]

960
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:20,014
I felt when your foot touched mine.

961
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:22,016
You must have felt
when my foot touched yours, no?

00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:30,357
If you deny it
to the bitter end… [sucks teeth]

965
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:32,318
Okay, I'm sorry.

966
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:38,198
The truth is, I stretched out my leg
at the wrong time that day.

967
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:40,409
I'm really sorry.

968
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:45,539
Lying to me won't help you out here.

969
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:49,793
But because you recognize
that I'm not a fool,

970
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:52,463
that means you aren't one either.

971
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:56,383
-[laughs nervously]
-So, since you mentioned it…

972
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:00,721
did you really stretch at the wrong time?

973
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:02,931
-It wasn't intentional?
-What?

974
00:44:03,515 --> 00:44:07,519
There are women who do anything it takes
to make sure you don't ever forget them.

975
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,188
It's true.

976
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:12,441
I see their faces, ask their names,
take pictures, and sign autographs.

977
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:14,985
And really, to be honest,
there are so many

978
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:16,320
that I can't remember every one.

979

[scoffs]

980
00:44:17,696 --> 00:44:20,115
But the ones who decide to hurt me
without a care in the world,

981
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:22,993
those are the ones
that I just cannot let go.

982
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:24,870
-[sighs]
-They really are pathetic.

983
00:44:26,121 --> 00:44:29,667
Oh, I'm not like that. I was stretching
my leg, and it just happened to--

984
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:32,294
If that was the case,
you should have said you were sorry.

985
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:34,755
-[gasps]
-I'm attacking an innocent person?

986
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:36,757
Is that the point
you're really trying to make?

987
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:39,677
I would've dropped it
if you just apologized,

988
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,720
but if you really did nothing wrong,
then prove it.

989
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:43,806
Let's go check Gilmu's security footage.

990
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:47,142
That way we'll know once and for all
if it really was an accident.

991
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:49,228
[gasps] Um, wait.

I'm really sorry.

994
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:56,652
I did it, okay?

995
00:44:57,861 --> 00:44:59,738
Because I'm such a huge fan of yours!

Yes.

00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:31,705
[grunts]

1023
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:37,294
[yawns]

[intriguing music continues]

1025
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:45,928
[groans]

1026
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:49,807
[Kang-ho] I just know her type.

1027
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:53,143
She pretends to be easygoing
and gets men to drop their guard.

1028
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:55,062
Then she seduces and uses them.

1029
00:46:55,562 --> 00:46:56,647
[groaning]

1030
00:46:58,148 --> 00:47:00,400
-[Kang-ho] She says she's a fan of mine.
-Hmm?

1031
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:02,903
But I think it'd be best
if she stays away from me.

1032
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:03,821
Mmm.

1033
00:47:05,697 --> 00:47:08,075
[man] Different woman, same problems, huh?

1034
00:47:09,117 --> 00:47:11,161
-Yeah.
-[man] What about Ji-woo?

1035
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:13,664
-You get along fine with her.
-I don't know anymore.

1036
00:47:13,747 --> 00:47:15,332
I can't stand these girls.

1037
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:21,088
[rhythmic music playing]

1038
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:22,756
[man] Hmm?

1039
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,716
Dude, isn't that Ji-woo?

1040
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:35,561
-Ji-woo.
-Hi.

1041
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:39,356
-What are you doing out here?
-[Ji-woo] I was just, um… waiting for you.

1042
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:42,025
[Kang-ho] It's been a while.
You look great.

1043
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:45,153
Yo, you forgot this.

1044
00:47:45,904 --> 00:47:47,406
[Kang-ho] Are you hungry?

1045
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:49,032
[suspenseful music playing]

1046
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:50,701
Why are you dressed so light?

1047
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:54,246
Come here, let me give you a hug.
You must be freezing.

1048
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:55,622
[upbeat music playing]

1049
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:57,374
Let's go inside.

1050
00:47:58,500 --> 00:47:59,334
Okay.

1051
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:03,589
[mouthing]

1052
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:05,173
See you around. Good night.

1053
00:48:06,341 --> 00:48:07,426
[door closes]

1054
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:13,348
[breathing heavily]

1055
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:19,980
[gasps] Have I been cursed somehow?

1056
00:48:25,193 --> 00:48:27,154
[Kang-ho]<i> I can't stand these girls.</i>

1057
00:48:29,823 --> 00:48:31,408
-[grunts]
-[clattering]

1058
00:48:31,491 --> 00:48:32,618
-Yes!
-[alarm blares]

1059
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:34,494
Uh-oh. Oh!

1060
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:38,832
[alarm continues blaring]

1061
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:44,296
Yes! At least they're outside now.

1062
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:49,676
[alarm continues blaring]

1063
00:48:54,681 --> 00:48:55,933
What's this?

1064
00:48:58,185 --> 00:48:59,686
Here. Have a good night.

1065
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:03,649
[laughs incredulously]

1066
00:49:03,732 --> 00:49:05,525
Guys really are the worst.

1067
00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:13,659
[police sirens approaching]

1068
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:20,332
POLICE

1069
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:24,086
[upbeat pop music playing]

1070
00:49:24,169 --> 00:49:27,130
Seriously? Is he actually
the president in disguise?

1071
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:29,007
[police radio beeping]
